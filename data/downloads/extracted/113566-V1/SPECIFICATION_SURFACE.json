  "notes": "Fuzzy regression discontinuity design studying the effect of grade retention on high school dropout in Chicago Public Schools. Uses test score cutoffs for promotional gates as instruments for retention. Running variable is normalized distance from promotional test score cutoff ('index'). Treatment is actual retention (dret2), instrumented by passage of the cutoff. Multiple experiments (grade 6, 8, and older 8th graders coded as newgrade=9) with year and failure-type variation. Main results in Table 2 (baseline RD) and Table 3 (robustness).",
