  "notes": "Ambuehl, Bernheim & Lusardi, 'Evaluating Deliberative Competence'. Two online RCTs studying whether a financial literacy intervention (Rule of 72 + framing rhetoric) improves compounding knowledge and financial decision-making. Experiment A has 4 arms (Control, Full, Rule72-only, Rhetoric-only); Experiment B has 2 arms (Control, Full). Main claims: (1) treatment improves compounding test scores; (2) treatment improves financial competence (reduces valuation errors between simple vs complex frames). Data is observation-level (subject x price-list), with multiple observations per subject. SE clustered at individual (id) level. Two baseline groups map to the paper's two headline claims.",
