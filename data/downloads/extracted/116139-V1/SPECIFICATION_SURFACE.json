  "notes": "Kosfeld and Rustagi (2015 AER) 'Leader Punishment and Cooperation in Groups: Experimental Field Evidence from Ethiopia'. Field experiment in Ethiopian forest commons. Leaders of forest user groups are classified into behavioral types (conditional cooperators [leq], conditional cooperators with efficiency concerns [leqef], and selfish [las]) based on lab-in-the-field games. Table 6 is the main cross-sectional analysis: OLS regression of group cooperation (pct = forest condition) on leader type dummies with group-level controls and village FE. Table 3 is the experimental punishment analysis using Poisson regression. We define two baseline groups: G1 for the cooperation-leader-type relationship (Table 6, primary claim), and G2 for leader punishment behavior (Table 3). Table 7 (panel FE within leader type over time) is treated as a robustness extension of G1.",

The paper treats these as quasi-random conditional on village: leaders are elected but their experimental type is not known to group members. OLS with robust SE (not clustered). Village FE absorb village-level confounders. Table A7 shows alternative inference including village-clustered SE and wild bootstrap. Dataset has 53 groups total, 51 with non-missing lcode. Analysis sample depends on controls/outcome missingness."
