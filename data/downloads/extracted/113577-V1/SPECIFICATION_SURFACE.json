  "notes": "Panel data study of peer effects among teachers on student test score growth. Uses North Carolina administrative education data. Main analysis regresses student test score growth on peer teacher quality measures (peer value-added or peer observable characteristics) with progressively richer fixed effects (school-year FE, student FE, teacher FE via felsdvreg two-way FE decomposition). Identification comes from within-teacher variation in peer composition across years. Two outcome subjects: math and reading.",
