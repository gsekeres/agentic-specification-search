  "notes": "Babcock, Recalde, Vesterlund (2017) 'Gender Differences in the Allocation of Low-Promotability Tasks: The Role of Backlash', AER P&P. Lab experiment with two treatment conditions (treatment=='Control': no backlash; treatment=='Backlash': penalty condition). NOTE: In the raw data, treatment is categorical ('Control'/'Backlash'), female is categorical ('Female'/'Male'), and student is categorical ('Freshman'/'Sophomore'/'Junior'/'Senior'). These must be converted to numeric before analysis. Random assignment at the session level. Main analysis (Table 1) uses probit regressions of the investment decision on solicited, female, and their interaction, with individual controls. The original do-file has a clustering bug (local clust_var vs clus_var), so the published probit estimates may not actually be clustered; cgmwildboot results provide the paper's primary inference.",
