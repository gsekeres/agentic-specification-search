  "notes": "Dafny (2005 AER) 'How Do Hospitals Respond to Price Changes?'. Exploits the 1988 Medicare PPS reform as a source of exogenous variation in DRG prices (weights). The paper has two main analyses: (1) Intensity analysis (Table 5, int.do): DRG-year panel estimating causal effect of DRG price (weight) on treatment intensity using Laspeyres price index as IV; (2) Upcoding analysis (Table 3, up.do): DRG-year panel estimating effect of price spread on fraction of patients coded with complications using IV. We define two baseline groups corresponding to these two main claims. The intensity analysis (Table 5) is the primary contribution; the upcoding analysis (Table 3) provides complementary evidence on hospital behavioral responses. DATA NOTE: The analysis data must be constructed by running the SAS programs (intdata.sas, updata.sas) on raw MedPAR 20% sample data. The raw SAS output files (drgcg, up, uphosp) are not included in the replication package. Only the DRG weights text file (drg85_96.txt) and PPS hospital-level files (pps*.dta) are provided directly. The runner must either construct the intermediate data or obtain pre-built Stata files.",
