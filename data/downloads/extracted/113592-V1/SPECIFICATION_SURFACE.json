  "notes": "Sharp regression discontinuity design studying the effect of need-based grants (BCS - bourses sur criteres sociaux) on college enrollment in France. Uses income-based eligibility cutoffs with local linear regression (LLR) and optimal bandwidth selection (Imbens-Kalyanaraman style via rdob). Multiple cutoffs for different grant levels: L0/No grant (0_X), L1/L0 (1_0), and L6-to-L1 (6_1). Running variable is inc_distance (negative of income distance from cutoff, so higher = poorer = more likely eligible). The main results are in Tables 3-5.",
