  "notes": "Steinwender (2018), 'Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom became United'. Exploits the transatlantic telegraph (1866) as a natural experiment. Daily time-series data on cotton prices in New York and Liverpool. Main analysis uses before/after comparison with Newey-West SE. Key tables: Table 2 (effect on price differences and variance), Table 8 (effect on trade levels), Table 9 (effect on trade variance). Also includes IV specifications (Table 3, information lag instrumented by telegraph), ARIMA price transmission (Tables 4-5), and structural demand/supply estimation (Tables 11-12). The design is primarily a before-after comparison (DiD in the simplest sense: pre vs post telegraph).",
