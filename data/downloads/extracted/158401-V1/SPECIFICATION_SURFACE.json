      "notes": "For RC/design specs, we run 3 focal outcomes per group: expenses_fert_seeds, tarpaulin_d, expenses_postharvest for G1; surplus, harvest_value, yield for G2. Functional form transforms (asinh/log1p) run on 2 continuous monetary focal outcomes only (excluding binary tarpaulin_d for G1 and yield for G2). Trimming for G1 runs on 2 continuous monetary focal outcomes only (excluding binary tarpaulin_d). All time/panel sample specs run on all 3 focal outcomes."
