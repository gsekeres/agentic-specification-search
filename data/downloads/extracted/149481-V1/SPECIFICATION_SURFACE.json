  "notes": "Three field experiments testing whether thank-you calls increase charitable giving. The paper's main analysis (Table 2) uses nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum, chi-square) for difference-in-means. Table A1 provides OLS/FE regressions with controls. We focus on Experiment 1 (public TV stations) as the primary baseline group since it is the largest, best-powered experiment with the richest covariate set. Experiment 2 (national non-profit) is a separate baseline group with a distinct population and no demographic controls available. Experiment 3 is treated as exploration (it tests a modified script variant, not a simple thank-you call effect).",
