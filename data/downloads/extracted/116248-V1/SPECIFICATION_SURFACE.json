The paper classifies subjects into behavioral types (Eq, L1, L2, L3, D1, D2) using MLE. The key finding is that subjects who comply with higher-level strategic thinking types (L1, L2) have systematically lower deviations from equilibrium predictions. The specification search tests robustness of the association between type compliance and guess accuracy.",
