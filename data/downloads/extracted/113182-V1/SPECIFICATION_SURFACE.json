Two distinct IV strategies: (1) Table 2 uses wind speed at 4:30 AM (plus_wind_00Z_10) as instrument for morning insurgent attacks (df_5to11) on voter turnout, at the district-election level with election FE, clustered by district; (2) Table 3 uses nighttime cloud cover (cloudz_perc_election) as instrument for IED deployment near roads (post_event_indicator) on vote totals at polling-station-road-segment level with district FE, robust and clustered SEs. Tables 6-7 are cross-sectional survey regressions (secondary, not IV).",
