        "selection_story": "The paper's central finding is that immigrant-founded firms have heavier-tailed firm size distributions (flatter power law slopes) than native-founded firms. The aggregated admin data from the Census reports log-frequency vs log-firm-size by immigrant status. The linear fit of this log-log relationship is the power law slope. The pooled regression with an immigrant interaction captures the slope difference directly as a regression coefficient.",

The immigrant coefficient captures the level difference in firm-formation rates; the interaction captures the slope difference (heavier tail). N=14 observations (7 firm-size bins x 2 groups). Defn1: immigrant startup = at least 1 foreign-born founder."
