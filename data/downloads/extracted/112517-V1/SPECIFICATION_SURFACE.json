  "notes": "Fowlie, Holland & Mansur (2012, AER) study the RECLAIM NOx cap-and-trade program in southern California. The paper uses a matching-based DiD design: nearest-neighbor matching (nnmatch) on pre-treatment emissions with exact industry matching, comparing RECLAIM-regulated facilities to non-regulated facilities across pre/post periods. The main estimand is the ATT of RECLAIM participation on the change in NOx emissions. The primary results appear in Tables 4 (levels) and their log equivalents. Tables 7 and 8 examine environmental justice (heterogeneous effects by neighborhood demographics). Table 5 examines small-firm effects. Table 6 provides SUTVA robustness checks.",
