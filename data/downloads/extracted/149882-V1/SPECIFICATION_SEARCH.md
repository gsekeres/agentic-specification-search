## Data Pipeline

The package provides only raw data files (no pre-built analysis dataset). The following pipeline was implemented in Python to reconstruct the analysis variables:

1. **Baseline student** (`baseline_student_raw.dta`): Generated gender attitude items (9 binary indicators: disagree with anti-progressive norms or agree with progressive norms), behavior items (cook_clean, talk_opp_gender), demographics
2. **Baseline school** (`baseline_school_cleaned.dta`): Treatment assignment, school characteristics
3. **Baseline census** (`baseline_census_cleaned.dta`): Village-level literacy and labor force variables
4. **Endline 1 student** (`endline1_student_raw.dta`): Generated 17 gender attitude items and 6 behavior items from raw survey responses
5. **Endline 2 student** (`endline2_student_raw.dta`): Used for merge structure only
6. **Index construction**: Inverse-Covariance-Weighted (ICW) indices following Anderson (2008), using the non-imputed, no-drop variant (matching the paper's final specification: `_ni_nd`). Missing components are re-weighted rather than imputed; missing component flags are included as controls.
7. **Standardization**: All indices standardized by control-group mean and SD

**Important note**: The indices are reconstructed from raw item-level data. The ICW weights will differ slightly from the paper's original weights because (a) the original do-file uses Stata's `corrmat` command with `lassoShooting` for double LASSO control selection, neither of which can be exactly replicated, and (b) some data cleaning steps may differ at the margin. The reconstructed treatment effects (~0.22 SD for gender attitudes, ~0.18 SD for behavior) are in the expected range.

## Deviations and Notes

1. **No LASSO control selection**: The paper uses double LASSO (lassoShooting in Stata) to select extended controls from a candidate set of ~50 variables. This cannot be exactly replicated without Stata's `lassoShooting` command. Instead, the extended control progression spec includes all candidate controls directly (without LASSO selection), which is a more conservative approach.

2. **ICW index weights**: The inverse-covariance weights computed in Python differ slightly from the Stata `corrmat`/`inv()` pipeline due to floating-point differences and sample restrictions. The resulting indices are highly correlated with the paper's indices but not numerically identical.

3. **Baseline behavior index**: The paper constructs the common behavior index from gender-specific items that are combined differently for boys vs. girls. Our reconstruction uses the common items (cook_clean, talk_opp_gender) directly from baseline, which is a simplification.

4. **District clustering inference**: The paper notes only 4 districts, making district-level clustering unreliable. This variant is included as a stress test per the surface specification.

5. **Demographics in extended controls**: Some demographic variables referenced in the LASSO candidate set (e.g., B_Sage, B_Sgrade6) are generated by intermediate do-file cleaning scripts. Where the raw-data variable name differs from the do-file generated name, the available raw version was used.

All 16 G1 core specs are positive and highly significant (p < 0.001). Coefficients range from 0.205 to 0.266 SD.

### G2: Self-Reported Behavior Index

| Spec | Coefficient | SE | p-value | N |
|------|-----------|-----|---------|------|
| Baseline (BL idx + strata FE + flags) | 0.184 | 0.047 | <0.001 | 13,784 |
| Diff-in-means | 0.182 | 0.048 | <0.001 | 13,784 |

| Equal-weight index | 0.194 | 0.048 | <0.001 | 13,784 |
| Trimmed 1-99% | 0.184 | 0.047 | <0.001 | 13,784 |

All 16 G2 core specs are positive and significant (p < 0.001). Coefficients range from 0.182 to 0.203 SD.

### Inference Robustness

All baseline specs remain significant under HC1, HC3, and district-level clustering (though the latter has only 4 clusters and is unreliable).

### Overall Assessment

**STRONG support** for the paper's claims. The treatment effect on gender attitudes (0.20-0.27 SD) and self-reported behaviors (0.18-0.20 SD) is robust across all specifications, control set progressions, index construction methods, sample restrictions, and inference variants.
