## Summary of Baseline Groups

### G1: Young Adult Living Alone (Table 1 Panel A, Col 3)
- **Outcome**: `myadult_aloneall_1830` (fraction of young adults 18-30 living alone)
- **Treatment**: `urate` (state unemployment rate)
- **FE**: State + Year (i.stfips + i.calyear)
- **Weights**: Analytic weights (`weight_1830`)
- **Clustering**: State level (`stfips`)
- **Verified against do-file**: MATCH. Line 47 of `regs_livarr.do` confirms `reg myadult_aloneall_1830 urate i.calyear i.stfips [aw=weight_1830], vce(cluster stfips)`.

### G2: Household Size (Table 1 Panel A, Col 1)
- **Outcome**: `h_numpers_noneld` (average household size, non-elderly)
- **Treatment**: `urate`
- **FE**: State + Year
- **Weights**: Analytic weights (`weight_noneld`)
- **Clustering**: State level (`stfips`)
- **Verified against do-file**: MATCH. Line 24 confirms `reg h_numpers_noneld urate i.calyear i.stfips [aw=weight_noneld], vce(cluster stfips)`.

**Claim grouping is correct**: G1 is the primary claim (young adult living arrangements), G2 is secondary (household size). Both share the same design and differ only in outcome and population/weights.

## Variable Name Verification

All variable names verified against `collapsed_state_aeapap.dta`:
- `myadult_aloneall_1830`, `myadult_aloneall_1824`, `myadult_aloneall_2530` -- CONFIRMED
- `h_numpers_noneld`, `h_numfams_noneld` -- CONFIRMED
- `urate`, `urate_80`, `urate_rest`, `urate_07` -- CONFIRMED
- `weight_1830`, `weight_1824`, `weight_2530`, `weight_noneld` -- CONFIRMED
- `statefip` (renamed to `stfips` in the do-file), `calyear` -- CONFIRMED

**NOTE**: The raw data column is `statefip`; the do-file renames it to `stfips`. The runner should rename in preprocessing or use `statefip` directly (with corresponding FE/cluster adjustments). Added a note to `design_audit`.

## Key Constraints and Linkage Rules

- **No controls pool**: The paper uses no covariates beyond state and year FE. This is correct -- confirmed from the do-file. The controls axis is empty.
- **No bundled estimator**: Simple OLS with absorbed FE. No linkage constraints.
- **Weight-outcome linkage**: Different age groups use different population weights (`weight_1830`, `weight_1824`, `weight_2530`). This is correctly noted. The runner must match weights to outcomes when varying age groups.
- **Panel B treatment decomposition**: The recession-period-specific treatment variables (`urate_80`, `urate_rest`, `urate_07`) are correctly treated as functional-form RC variants, not separate baseline groups.

---

## Changes Made

1. **Added note to G1 `design_audit.notes`**: Clarified that the raw data column is `statefip` (renamed to `stfips` by the do-file). Python code should use `statefip` directly or rename.

2. **Updated `infer/se/cluster/region` variant notes**: Added that `region` must be constructed from state FIPS codes since it does not exist in the data. Provided Census region mapping guidance.

---

## Budget/Sampling Assessment

- **G1 budget (55 specs)**: Feasible. The universe is generated by combining discrete axes:
  - 3 age-group outcomes (18-30, 18-24, 25-30)
  - ~3 functional form variants (level, log outcome, log treatment)
  - 3 recession-specific treatment variants
  - ~4 FE variants (baseline, drop state, add state trend, add region*year, add division*year)
  - 2 weighting variants (weighted, unweighted)
  - ~4 time period restrictions
  - ~3 outlier/sample restrictions
  - 1 design alternative (first difference)
  - Plus joint combinations
  - Full enumeration is correct; no sampling needed.

- **G2 budget (25 specs)**: Feasible. Fewer axes than G1 (no age group variation, fewer FE variants).

- **Combined target (~80 specs)**: Reasonable and achievable.

## What's Missing

1. **Region variable construction**: The inference variant `infer/se/cluster/region` requires constructing a Census region variable from `statefip`. This is straightforward but needs to be documented in the runner implementation. (Addressed with note update.)

2. **Division variable for `rc/fe/add_division_year`**: Similarly, Census division must be constructed from state FIPS codes. Not in the data.

3. **Recession year definition for `rc/sample/time/drop_recession_years`**: The surface does not specify which years are considered "recession years." Recommend using NBER recession dates: 1980-1982, 1990-1991, 2001, 2007-2009.

4. **Population threshold for `rc/sample/outliers/drop_small_states`**: The surface does not specify the cutoff. Recommend using bottom quartile of state population (from weight variables).

5. **`myadult_aloneall_noneld` as additional outcome for G2**: The data contains `myadult_aloneall_noneld` (fraction living alone for all non-elderly, not just young adults). This could be an additional outcome RC for G2 to complement the household size measure. Consider adding as `rc/form/outcome/myadult_aloneall_noneld`.

## Final Assessment

**APPROVED TO RUN** -- no blocking issues.

The surface is well-constructed. The baseline specifications exactly match the do-file. The RC axes are appropriate for the panel FE design. The budget is feasible. Minor issues (region/division variable construction, recession year definition, small-state threshold) are implementation details that do not affect the surface structure.
