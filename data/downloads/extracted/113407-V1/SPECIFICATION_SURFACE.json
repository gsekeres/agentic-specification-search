  "notes": "Hoynes (2014 AER P&P) 'Living Arrangements, Doubling Up, and the Great Recession'. State-year panel from March CPS 1980-2013, examining how living arrangements respond to state unemployment rate fluctuations. Panel A (Table 1) regresses living arrangement measures on the state unemployment rate with state and year FE, weighted by population, SE clustered at state level. Panel B allows recession-period-specific coefficients. Two headline outcomes are household size and fraction living alone (young adults 18-30). We focus on the 18-30 young adult living-alone outcome as the main baseline claim since it is the paper's central finding, with household size as a second baseline group.",
