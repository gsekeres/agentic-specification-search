  "global_notes": "Paper: 'The Price of Experience' (AER). Mincerian wage equation with PSID panel data. All 70 specifications are positive and significant at 1%. The coefficient ranges from 0.017 (without exp-squared, capturing average slope) to 0.074 (max exp 20, capturing steeper part of curve). The functional form assumption (quadratic experience) matters greatly: dropping exp-squared reduces the coefficient from 0.049 to 0.017. Returns to education (~0.099) are treated as a robustness check."
