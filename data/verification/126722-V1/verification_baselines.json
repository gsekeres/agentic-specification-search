  "global_notes": "RCT of malaria treatment vouchers in Mali. Three arms: patient voucher, doctor voucher, control. Patient voucher effect is highly robust (100% positive, 94.5% significant at 5%). Doctor voucher shows minimal effect. Alternative outcomes (severe malaria, prescribed treatment) show weaker effects. Treatment-illness match quality decreases slightly, suggesting some overtreatment."
