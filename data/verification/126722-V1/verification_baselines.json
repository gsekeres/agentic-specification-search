      "notes": "All 5 baselines correspond to Table 3 columns in the original paper. The paper uses pdslasso for control selection; the replication uses manual covariates from Table B10 (Appendix). Coefficients are close but not identical to published values, consistent with the pdslasso approximation. Surface correctly groups all 5 outcomes under a single baseline group since the claim object (voucher effects on treatment) is unified. Design variants and RC specs also cover multiple outcomes, primarily RXtreat_sev_simple_mal and treat_sev_simple_mal."

  "global_notes": "No changes to baseline-group assignments relative to the surface. The surface defined one group (G1) covering all 5 Table 3 outcomes; the executed results are fully consistent with this plan. All 57 rows in specification_results.csv have run_success=1. The 5 inference variant rows are correctly placed in inference_results.csv (not in specification_results.csv). Duplicate coefficient values were found across some spec pairs (e.g., rc/controls/sets/none replicates design/diff_in_means, rc/controls/sets/extended replicates baseline, rc/fe/add/clinic replicates design/strata_fe). These are mechanically valid but represent redundant specifications."
