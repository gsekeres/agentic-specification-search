  "global_notes": "This paper uses simulated data calibrated to match reported treatment effects, so coefficients are approximate rather than exact replications. The specification search identified 69 total specs. Key issues: (1) some specs appear as duplicates across categories (e.g., robust/sample/expA_only duplicates the full-controls baseline, robust/outcome/discount_unframed duplicates the placebo/simple_frame spec, robust/outcome/score_indexing duplicates placebo/score_indexing); (2) heterogeneity specs report interaction coefficients rather than main effects, which is appropriate for testing heterogeneity but makes them non-core for the main claim; (3) functional form specs (log, IHS, sqrt) transform absDiff rather than negAbsDiff, so negative coefficients are expected and correct; (4) alternative treatment specs (Rule72, Rhetoric) test different causal objects than the baseline Full treatment."
