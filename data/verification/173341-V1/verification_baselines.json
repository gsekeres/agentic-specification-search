  "global_notes": "Paper studies how reducing vulnerability (via cisterns and rainfall) decreases clientelism in rural Brazil. 92 specs. Main cistern effect robust across municipality drops (jackknife), controls, clustering. Alternative outcomes mixed. Rainfall effect shows complementary channel. Frequent interactors show much larger effects (-0.118). Household wellbeing outcomes also support the mechanism."
