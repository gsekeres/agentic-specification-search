The 'baseline_rainfall' spec comes from the same regression but reports the rainfall_std_stacked coefficient, which is a separate estimand (the rainfall channel). The 'baseline_interaction' spec reports the interaction coefficient from Table 3 Col 4, which tests a distinct hypothesis (complementarity between treatment and rainfall)."

  "global_notes": "The paper has two main causal channels: (1) the experimental cisterns treatment and (2) rainfall shocks, both affecting vulnerability and consequently clientelistic behavior. Many specification rows use treatment variables that are interactions (treat_freq, treat_assoc, treat_high_rain, treat_2012, treat_2013, rain_2012, rain_2013, treat_rain_std) which test heterogeneity or related hypotheses rather than the core claim. The specification search also includes household-level vulnerability outcomes (Table 2) and individual-level outcomes (Table 1) that are mechanism checks, not the main clientelism claim. The duplicate spec 'robust/outcome/ask_private_stacked' is identical to the baseline and should be flagged. The spec 'robust/placebo/public_goods' duplicates 'robust/outcome/ask_public_stacked' (same regression, different labeling)."
