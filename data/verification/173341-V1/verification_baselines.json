  "global_notes": "No changes to baseline group assignments relative to the surface. The surface correctly identified two baseline groups: G1 (individual-level clientelist behavior, Table 3) and G2 (section-level electoral outcomes, Table 4). The runner produced cross-product combinations of spec_id variations with year subsamples and engagement controls, resulting in duplicate spec_ids within G1 (45 rows vs 21 planned core specs). This is not invalid but reflects a larger-than-planned specification set. All 51 rows are valid and core."
