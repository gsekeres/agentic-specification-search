The sign difference reflects different specifications -- the pooled two-way FE shows negative (higher benefits -> higher unemployment). The paper's primary claim is about heterogeneity in the UI-unemployment elasticity by age, not just the average effect."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Optimal Life Cycle Unemployment Insurance' by Michelacci & Ruffo (AER). The specification search covers the CPS panel analysis (Figure 1b and related). Two baseline specs exist: one with age-specific structure (positive coef) and one pooled (negative coef). The key insight is about age heterogeneity: young workers show positive coefficients while older workers show negative. The structural model (optimal UI design) is not covered."
