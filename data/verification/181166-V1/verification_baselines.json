Outcome is change in log real weekly earnings (winsorized at 2.5%). Model includes year and year-of-job-loss FE, full demographic/employment controls, clustered at displaced occupation level (dwocc1990), weighted by DWS supplement weights."

  "global_notes": "Paper has a single core claim with one baseline specification. The specification search produced 67 specs total. One critical data quality issue: the shuffled_treatment placebo (spec 66) has identical coefficient, SE, p-value, and R-squared to the baseline, indicating the shuffle was not properly applied. Several heterogeneity specs report the treatment_var as the interaction term name but the coefficient in coefficient_vector_json actually corresponds to the main treatment effect d_computer_2017_2007_n; this is a labeling inconsistency in those rows."
