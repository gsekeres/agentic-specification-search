- **Authors**: Arifovic, Hommes, Kopanyi-Peuker, Salle
- **Journal**: AEJ-Microeconomics
- **Total Specifications**: 69

## Baseline Groups

### G1: Larger groups (80-90) coordinate worse than smaller groups (10), leading to more...
- **Expected sign**: +
- **Baseline spec(s)**: baseline
- **Outcome**: withdraw
- **Treatment**: large
- **Notes**: Logit coef=0.507, p=0.010. Period 8, all treatments except 7. Positive = large groups withdraw more.
