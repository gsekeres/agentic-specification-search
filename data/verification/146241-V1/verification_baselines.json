  "global_notes": "69 total specifications. 45 are core tests of the group-size claim (controls, sample, inference, method, FE, and functional form variations). 24 are non-core: 5 placebo tests (training periods and permuted treatments), 13 heterogeneity/interaction specs (conditional main effects not comparable to unconditional baseline), and 6 alternative-treatment specs (pastDecision within single treatments, testing a different hypothesis). The paper Table 4 columns 2-3 and 5 include interaction terms that change the estimand of the large coefficient, making them non-comparable to the baseline."
