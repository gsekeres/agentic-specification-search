      "notes": "Theoretical/calibration paper. No empirical data or regression. The 'coefficient' is bstar (equilibrium debt level) from the calibrated model. Baseline parameters: chi=0.1547, rho=0.07, r=0.06, psi=0.2, piBar=0.2, log utility. Key test: bstar (1.677) > bPi (0.198), confirming overborrowing. Standard errors and p-values are not applicable -- robustness is assessed via parameter sensitivity. Replication matches paper values to within 0.12% (ODE discretization difference)."

  "global_notes": "This is a purely theoretical paper with numerical calibration (Aguiar, Amador, Farhi, Gopinath, AER P&P 2014). There are no empirical regressions. The specification search varies calibration parameters and functional form (utility function) to test robustness of the overborrowing result. All 78 converging specifications maintain bstar > bPi, confirming the qualitative result is robust. Several spread/rho/extreme specs are exact duplicates due to overlapping parameter configurations. The 3 counterfactual and 2 placebo specs test different economic regimes rather than robustness of the baseline claim."
