The paper's main results use individual-level PSID data (unavailable), so this specification search tests only the first-stage relationship using district-level panel data. The baseline coefficient is 0.021 (p=0.51), not statistically significant with state-level clustering. Spec did/fe/state is numerically identical to baseline (exact duplicate)."

  "global_notes": "This paper's main hypothesis concerns dynamic complementarity between Head Start and K12 spending on children's outcomes, but the replication data only supports the first-stage analysis (SFR -> spending). The specification search therefore tests a subsidiary claim. The baseline is not statistically significant (p=0.51). did/fe/state and robust/cluster/state are exact duplicates of baseline. Treatment variations (rows 1-5) change the causal object to different reform types/intensities. Heterogeneity interaction specs (rows 46-49) report the interaction coefficient, not the main effect. Regional and income subsample specs represent heterogeneity splits rather than robustness of the average effect."
