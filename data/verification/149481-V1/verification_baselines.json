Surface planned named IDs (baseline__t2_exp1_renewing, etc.) but runner used generic 'baseline' for all. All baselines have very small, non-significant treatment effects (all p > 0.20).

  "global_notes": "Surface-driven run. Both baseline groups match the pre-run surface. All 87 rows succeed (run_success=1). No infer/* rows in specification_results.csv; inference variants are in inference_results.csv (16 rows). Key issues: (1) All baseline spec_ids are 'baseline' rather than the named IDs the surface planned (e.g., baseline__t2_exp1_renewing); the baselines are distinguishable by outcome_var and group. (2) The 'donated' and 'renewing' outcomes appear to be the same underlying variable (identical coefficients in diff-in-means specs), creating some redundancy. (3) The design/diff_in_means specs for renewing and donated produce identical results, confirming they are the same variable. (4) 77/87 rows use infer/se/iid (classical OLS SE) and 10/87 use infer/se/nonparametric/ranksum_chi2 (Table 2 baseline diff-in-means). This is correct: the surface canonical applies to diff-in-means specs only; OLS specs correctly use classical SE. (5) Ten diff-in-means baseline rows have missing r_squared (expected for nonparametric tests). This is a well-powered null result paper."
