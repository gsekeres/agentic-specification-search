  "global_notes": "This paper reports null findings across all three experiments and both outcomes. The six baselines correspond to 3 experiments x 2 outcomes. Expected sign is marked unknown because the paper tests whether the effect is positive but ultimately finds null effects. All specifications use treat (thank-you call assignment) as treatment. Experiments 1 and 3 include station x execution-date FE; Experiment 2 has no FE. Heterogeneity and interaction specs are classified as non-core since they test conditional effects rather than the main average treatment effect."
