The effect is significant without market clustering (p=0.004) or without market FE (p<0.001), but proper two-way FE + clustering renders it insignificant."

The baseline result is consistently positive but NOT statistically significant with proper inference. All 56 specifications show positive coefficients. Significance depends heavily on FE structure and clustering choice. did/fe/twoway is a duplicate of baseline (identical coefficients)."
