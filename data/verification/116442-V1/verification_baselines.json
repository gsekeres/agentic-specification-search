  "global_notes": "56 total specs. Baseline result is not statistically significant (p=0.125). Significance is highly sensitive to FE structure and clustering. Multiple specs are exact duplicates of baseline due to collinearity with market FE. Dynamic effects use different treatment variables (event-time indicators). Two alternative outcomes (log_PLANS_i, log_EFFPLi) measure different quantities than foggy plans."
