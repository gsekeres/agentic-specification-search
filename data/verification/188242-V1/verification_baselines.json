  "global_notes": "Paper estimates gravity equations for bilateral trade. The 74 specifications all relate to the single core claim about the distance elasticity of trade. Alternative treatment specs (weighted distance, contiguity, colony) and alternative outcome specs (trade quantity, trade intensity) are classified as noncore because they test different claims (different coefficient interpretations) even though the underlying regression structure is similar. Placebo tests with scrambled distance or non-trade outcomes are noncore. Heterogeneity interaction specs test whether the distance effect varies by subgroup, not whether the baseline distance effect exists, so they are noncore. Specs with trade_intensity outcome (r_squared = -Inf) appear to have estimation issues and are classified as invalid."
