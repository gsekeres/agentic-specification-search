  "global_notes": "Paper studies effects of Youth Employment Training in Uruguay using lottery-based IV. Employment effects are highly robust (100% positive, 100% significant at 1%). Many alternative outcomes tested (soft skills, study habits) with mixed significance. Leave-one-out control specs show identical coefficients suggesting controls have minimal impact with strong instrument."
