  "global_notes": "The paper has one primary claim (employment effect, G1) and four secondary outcome claims (G2-G5). The specification search covers robustness checks (control variations, sample restrictions, estimation methods) plus alternative outcomes (soft skills, education metrics, industry composition), heterogeneity analyses, and placebo/balance tests. Many leave-one-out control specs produce identical coefficients to the baseline, suggesting the dropped variables were not in the baseline control set. The first-stage and reduced-form specs are diagnostics, not core tests."
