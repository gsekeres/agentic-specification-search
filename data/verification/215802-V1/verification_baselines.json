  "global_notes": "Paper: 'Long-Run Impacts of Childhood Access to the Safety Net' by Hoynes, Schanzenbach & Almond (AER). CRITICAL: The public replication package lacks county identifiers needed for the original identification strategy. This spec search uses current FS receipt (not childhood exposure) as treatment, yielding fundamentally different estimates driven by selection. Panel FE specs for income/employment show strong negative associations (FS recipients are poorer), confirming selection. Cross-sectional health results are not significant. 80 total specs."
