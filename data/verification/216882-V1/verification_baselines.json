Outcome is long-difference in log total Black arrest rates (sheriff + police combined). Baseline uses basic controls (pop, black_share) with state FE and judicial division clustering. The proxy for black_share60 was constructed from child population data rather than full Census data."

  "global_notes": "This paper uses cross-sectional OLS on long-differenced outcomes. The replication was constructed from raw public data since intermediate datasets were not available. The treatment variable (black_share60_proxy x coverage) is an approximation using child population nonwhite share as a proxy for black_share60. Coefficients should be interpreted for sign and approximate magnitude rather than exact replication. 78 total specifications. The paper's main finding is that VRA coverage reduced Black arrest rates in counties with higher Black population shares."
