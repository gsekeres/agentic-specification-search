  "global_notes": "65 total specifications. Several specs have numerically zero coefficients due to estimation failures (winsorization at 1/5/10 pct, early_period, late_period, canal_counties_only, non_canal_counties). The pre-treatment trend spec uses a different treatment variable and a restricted sample, making it a diagnostic. The alternative treatment spec (distance_canal) changes the causal object. Heterogeneity specs add triple-interaction terms and thus test a different estimand. Some outcome variants (attacks, defend) represent genuinely different outcome concepts."
