Col 5 (full FE + all 15 controls) fails with singular matrix error. Outcome: asinh(rebellion onset per 1600 population). Treatment: interaction1 = alongcanal x reform (binary canal proximity x post-closure). Design: TWFE DiD with county and year FE, clustered at county level."

All planned specs from the surface core_universe were executed (47 total). 16 failures: 4 from singular matrix (col 5 baseline + 3 LOO/set variants with all 15 controls), 11 from duplicate column names in the merged sample-restriction data, and 1 outlier-trim that also hits the duplicate-column bug. No baseline-group reassignment needed. No spurious groups found."
