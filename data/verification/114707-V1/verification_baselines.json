  "global_notes": "Single baseline group corresponding to the main claim about merger effects on non-medical hospital prices. Medical price specifications are treated as placebo/alternative outcome tests. Alternative treatment definitions (active/passive, in-state/out-state, HHI terciles, bed-share terciles, size difference, indirect) change the causal object and are classified as non-core. One specification (robust/het/by_system_nonmember) failed to estimate and is invalid. The control progression endpoint (robust/control/add_sysoth) is numerically identical to baseline. The placebo medical-prices specification appears twice under different tree paths (robust/outcome/lnprmed and robust/placebo/outcome_lnprmed)."
