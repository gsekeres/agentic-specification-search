  "global_notes": "The paper tests motivated beliefs via a lab experiment with 200 subjects. The primary hypothesis (G1) concerns asymmetric belief updating: subjects respond more to good news in No-Resolution but symmetrically in Resolution. The secondary hypotheses (G2, G3) concern ex-post rationalization of performance relevance. Some spec-search specs with outcome rang1-4posteriorbelief use rank-specific probability beliefs rather than the expected-rank summary measure (belief_adjustment) -- these are alternative measurements of the same underlying belief-updating concept. The heterogeneity splits (by age, IQ, prior, rank) run the same estimating equation on subsamples but are not separate baseline claims. The DID specifications (baseline_nores_did, baseline_res_did) pool good and bad signals with interaction terms, effectively nesting the separate good/bad signal regressions."
