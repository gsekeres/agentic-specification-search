Coefficient -19.64 (SE 0.66, p~0). N=18,389, R2=0.36. This captures the publicly-observable manifestation of the paper's main claim about screening through formulary design. The paper's proprietary Table 3 regressions use therapeutic-class-level selection incentive measures that are not available in the replication data."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Screening in Contract Design: Evidence from the ACA Health Insurance Exchanges' by Geruso, Layton, Prinz (AER). The paper's main Table 3 regressions use proprietary Marketscan claims + MMIT formulary data to measure selection incentives at the therapeutic class level. The specification search uses only publicly available CCIIO Plan Attributes and Benefits Cost Sharing PUFs (2015), capturing the cost-sharing patterns that are the observable consequence of screening. The analysis has two natural baseline groups: (G1) the CSR comparison within Silver plans (baseline spec), and (G2) the generosity x tier interaction across all metals (ols/interact/generosity_x_hightier). Several specs are duplicates across categories: panel/fe/none = robust/controls/none, panel/fe/issuer = robust/controls/tier_issuer, robust/sample/drop_platinum = robust/leave_one_out/drop_platinum, robust/form/binary_subj_ded = robust/outcome/subj_ded, robust/sample/drop_catastrophic = robust/leave_one_out/drop_catastrophic. Sign interpretation varies: for CSR/deductible/coinsurance outcomes, negative means more generous plans have lower cost-sharing (expected). For the generosity_score treatment with copay outcome, positive reflects composition (higher-metal plans cover more expensive drugs). There are 90 total specifications."
