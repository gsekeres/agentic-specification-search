  "global_notes": "This paper (Knittel, AER 2011) estimates attribute-fuel economy trade-offs using panel fixed effects on vehicle-level data 1980-2006. There is a single baseline group tracking the lcurbwt coefficient. The specification search explores 73 total specifications across functional form, FE structure, SE clustering, sample restrictions, control sets, estimation methods, interactions, alternative coefficients, and dependent variable transformations. Key findings: (1) The weight elasticity is very robust across Cobb-Douglas specifications (-0.26 to -0.50). (2) Translog linear coefficients are not comparable because the total elasticity requires evaluation at sample means. (3) The random effects estimate has the wrong sign (+0.74), confirming Hausman-test-like evidence that FE is necessary. (4) Three specs report alternative coefficients (lhp instead of lcurbwt), which track a different estimand. (5) The 'kitchen_sink' spec is identical to the translog_with_turbo_super spec."
