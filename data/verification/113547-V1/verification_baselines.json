  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Stealth Consolidation: Evidence from an Amendment to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act' by Thomas Wollmann (AER: Insights). The data consists of merger counts aggregated to 72 observations (18 years x 2 exemption groups x 2 merger types). The main identification is a triple DID: post (year>2001) x horizontal (same 4-digit SIC) x below (newly-exempt). The specification search generates 93 total specifications. Many specs come in triplets: triple-diff, newly-exempt DID, and never-exempt DID (placebo). The never-exempt specs are classified as non-core placebo tests since they verify the control group shows no effect. Dollar-value outcome specs, horizontal-only DDs, non-horizontal-only DDs, horizontal share DD, and total mergers DD are classified as non-core because they use different outcome variables or fundamentally different treatment structures. Software-only heterogeneity analyses and placebo timing tests are also non-core. All sample restrictions (excl. software, excl. large mergers, time windows, post-period redefinitions, LOO), functional form changes (levels, Poisson, IHS, first differences), FE/controls variations (linear/quadratic trends), inference changes (classical SE), and weighting (WLS) are classified as core when applied to the triple-diff or newly-exempt DID."
