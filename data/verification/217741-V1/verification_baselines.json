Cross-sectional WLS of DHS percent change in female employment share on AI exposure percentiles, with sector and country FE. Two AI measures diverge substantially: Felten is robust and significant, Webb is marginal. 136 specs split evenly between the two measures. Leave-one-out country and occupation specs test sensitivity. Sector-specific results show strong heterogeneity."
