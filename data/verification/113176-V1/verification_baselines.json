All produce nearly identical estimates. The primary baseline (station FE only, coef=5.31, SE=0.076, p<0.001) is the paper's central formalized claim. The paper itself is primarily descriptive, documenting price coordination through figures rather than formal regression tables; these specifications formalize the paper's central empirical assertion."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Learning to Coordinate: A Study in Retail Gasoline' by Byrne & de Roos (AER). The paper studies tacit collusion and price coordination in the Perth retail gasoline market, documenting how BP led a transition from irregular to coordinated weekly Thursday price cycles around March 2010. The specification search formalizes the paper's central empirical claim as a panel regression of retail margins on a post-coordination dummy with station fixed effects. There are 70 total specifications. The paper is fundamentally a before/after comparison with no untreated control group -- the post_coord dummy is a pure time variable, so month FE would absorb the treatment. Year FE can be included (reducing the estimate to ~4.66 cpl). Placebo tests (fake treatment dates 2005-2008 in the pre-period) produce positive and significant effects (1.2-2.1 cpl), suggesting a pre-existing upward trend in margins that accounts for some fraction of the baseline 5.3 cpl estimate. Quantile regressions are non-core because they use a fundamentally different estimator (unconditional quantile regression without station FE). The 4 baseline specs are extremely close in coefficient value (5.31-5.35 cpl) and are treated as a single baseline group."
