Effect is robust across most specs. 92% positive, 80% significant at 5%. Elderly population shows much larger effect (0.112). Working-age population shows no significant effect."

  "global_notes": "Panel FE study of temperature-mortality relationship in Mexico, municipality-month level 1998-2017. 64 total specs. The positive effect of hot days on mortality is robust. Key heterogeneity: effect concentrated in elderly and children, not working-age adults. Cold states show larger effect than hot states (adaptation). State-by-year FE absorb the effect entirely (p=0.997), suggesting the identifying variation is at the state-year level."
