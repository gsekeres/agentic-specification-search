  "global_notes": "64 specs total. 14 heterogeneity specs, 2 alt-outcome specs, 3 alt-treatment specs, and 2 placebo tests classified as non-core (21 total non-core). 43 core specs test the baseline claim through FE, controls, sample, inference, functional form, and method variations. The all_temp_bins spec changes treatment_var to scale_32_p_m but conceptually measures the same heat effect."
