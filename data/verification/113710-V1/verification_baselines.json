  "global_notes": "The specification search covers 95 specs. One main baseline claim: alignment causes higher transfers. Competition-moderation is secondary (heterogeneity). First-stage/reduced-form and covariate balance tests are diagnostic. Placebo cutoff tests are noncore_placebo. Several specs duplicate results under different labels. Some OLS specs use a different estimator but test the same directional claim. Region-specific heterogeneity specs run OLS on individual region subsamples."
