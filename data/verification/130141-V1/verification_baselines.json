  "global_notes": "Paper studies news shocks under financial frictions using SVAR and DSGE. The specification search covers only the VAR component. The key metric is FEVD (share of GDP variance explained by TFP shocks). Results are sensitive to sample period (post-2000 much stronger) and lag selection (AIC/BIC select p=1 with 7.5% FEVD vs paper's p=5 with 22.3%). Excluding 2008-2009 drops FEVD to 2.4%. Rolling windows show instability."
