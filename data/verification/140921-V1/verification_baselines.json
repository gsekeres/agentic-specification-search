  "global_notes": "Surface-driven run. Both baseline groups match the pre-run surface. No adjustments needed. All 50 rows succeed (run_success=1). No infer/* rows in specification_results.csv; inference variants are properly in inference_results.csv. One non-core row: run_022 (mheir outcome for G1) changes the outcome concept from 'married commoner' to 'married heir', which is a distinct claim object. The quadratic treatment form (run_021 for G1, run_047 for G2) produces negative coefficients reflecting the quadratic's linear term, not a sign reversal."
