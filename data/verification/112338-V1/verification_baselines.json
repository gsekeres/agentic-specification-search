  "global_notes": "No changes to baseline group assignments relative to the surface. The surface correctly identified two baseline groups: G1 for price effects (Table 2) and G2 for quantity effects (Table 3). The dominant issue is the extremely high failure rate (34 of 56 total specs = 60.7%) because many specifications require proprietary IMS Health variables (e.g., imsgrouprank03, meps0203scripts weights) that are not included in the replication package. Only MEPS-derived variables are available. Treatment variable alternatives (mcar0203mepspd, mcself0203mepsrx) are core form variations, not concept drift."
