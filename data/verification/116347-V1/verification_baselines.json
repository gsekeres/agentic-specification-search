The paper's actual main variable is proximity-based (working alongside friends), not just presence-based. Specs without worker FE show positive significant effects due to selection."

  "global_notes": "Paper studies workplace friendships and productivity in a fruit-packing plant. The replication uses a simplified treatment (friend presence) rather than the paper's main treatment (friend proximity/position). 10 specs failed with collinearity errors. The null baseline result is robust across most within-worker specifications. Positive effects appear only in specs without worker FE (reflecting selection, not causation). Total valid specs: ~60 out of 79."
