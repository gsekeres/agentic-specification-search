  "global_notes": "2x2 factorial RCT of peer referral mechanisms in consumer credit (South Africa). Small sample: only 243 loans with outcome data from 4,454 referrals. 236 total specs, with each outcome x treatment combination tested separately. Enforcement effect is the main robust finding; selection effect is consistently null. Specs come in pairs (enforcement/selection) for each outcome."
