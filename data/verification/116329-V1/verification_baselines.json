Treatment: binary poorly matched indicator. This specification uses the full sample (N=544, no interest rate restriction) since the loss variable is defined conditional on account choice. The baseline is Column 2 (with interest rate controls) rather than Column 1 (no controls) because interest rate controls are essential to the experimental design. Coefficient 0.42 indicates poorly matched couples lose an additional 0.42 percentage points in interest."

  "global_notes": "This is Schaner (AEJ:Applied 2015), a field experiment in Kenya studying intrahousehold preference heterogeneity and strategic savings behavior. The 108 specifications systematically vary 8 dimensions: (1) outcome variable (savedI, saved_ncI, openI, ln_avg_balI, depI, savedJ, savedIH, savedIW, loss_i0, plus winsorized and account-level variants), (2) control set (C1 basic through C5 full, plus drop-one-group variants), (3) sample (all couples, savers only, no interest rate restriction, include polygamous), (4) heterogeneity measure (log discount factor at p50/p33/p67, probit-based at p50, continuous), (5) standard error type (HC1, cluster, probit robust, logit robust), (6) estimation method (OLS, probit marginal effects, logit marginal effects), (7) outcome winsorization (none, 95th, 99th percentile), and (8) unit of analysis (couple-level, account-level). The primary finding (savedI, binary bad treatment) is highly robust: 31 of 32 specifications are significant at 5%. The effect size ranges from 0.067 to 0.321 across all savedI specifications. Progressive addition of controls increases the point estimate from 0.106 to 0.146, suggesting omitted variable bias attenuates the unconditional relationship."
