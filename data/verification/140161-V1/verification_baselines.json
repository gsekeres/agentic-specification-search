  "global_notes": "Baseline group assignments match the SPECIFICATION_SURFACE.json exactly. No reassignments made. G1 has two co-equal baselines (intent-to-share outcome and behavioral action outcome) each reported twice (once per focal treatment arm: survey2=Imposed, survey3=Voluntary). G2 has one baseline (intent to share fact-check, survey3=Voluntary vs Imposed). The rc/form/outcome/share_click2 spec in G1 is numerically identical to baseline__share_action_g1 because the surface lists share_click2 as both a co-baseline and an rc/form variant (treating want_share_fb as the canonical reference). Both are valid; the functional_form block in the rc/form row correctly identifies the semantic role. All 222 rows ran successfully; no failures.",
