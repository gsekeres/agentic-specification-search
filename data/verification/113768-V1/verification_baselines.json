  "global_notes": "This paper examines whether birth in a zodiac-auspicious year affects child outcomes in Vietnam. Three distinct outcome domains are tested: cohort fertility (N=22 year-level), education (N=6.6M individual-level), and health/height (N=57K individual-level). Key vulnerability: all main results are critically sensitive to the quadratic birth-year trend specification. With a linear trend only, effects vanish across all three outcomes. Education inference relies on only 21 birth-year clusters. The treatment decomposition reveals effects are driven by boy-auspicious years, not the gender-matched mechanism the paper emphasizes. 93 total specifications."
