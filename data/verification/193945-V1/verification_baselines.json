  "global_notes": "This paper has a complex structure: the baseline is a variance decomposition, not a regression. The spec search translates the decomposition into a single baseline row and then provides many cross-sectional regressions from different paper tables (Table 3, 5, 6, Appendix Tables 1-2). CRITICAL: Many robustness specs (sample restrictions, time periods, industry heterogeneity, clustering, functional form, controls) are SYNTHETIC -- generated by applying scalar multipliers to the firm_effect/log_size baseline coefficient (0.034) rather than from actual paper estimates. The SEs are also mechanically computed. This substantially undermines their value as robustness checks. Additionally, most Table 3 specs (ols/*) are regressions of DIFFERENT outcome variables on DIFFERENT treatment variables, making them separate findings rather than robustness tests of a single claim."
