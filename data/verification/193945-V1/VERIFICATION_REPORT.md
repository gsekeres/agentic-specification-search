## Baseline Groups

### G1: Variance share of place effects (AKM decomposition)
- **Baseline spec_id**: `baseline`
- **Claim**: CZ-level place effects (averaged firm fixed effects from AKM decomposition) explain approximately 29% of geographic earnings variance.
- **Outcome**: `mean_log_earnings_cz`; **Treatment**: `cz_place_effect`
- **Coefficient**: 0.2926 (SE = 0.015)
- **Notes**: This is a variance decomposition share, not a standard regression coefficient. Only the model comparison specs (robust/model/*) directly test the stability of this decomposition.

### G2: Size elasticity of firm effects (place premiums)
- **Baseline spec_id**: `ols/firm_effect/on_log_size`
- **Claim**: The elasticity of CZ-level firm effects (place premiums) with respect to CZ population size is approximately 0.034.
- **Outcome**: `mean_firm_effect`; **Treatment**: `log_size`
- **Coefficient**: 0.034 (SE = 0.0031)
- **Notes**: This is the specification most frequently varied in robustness checks. Many robustness specs are synthetic (see below).

## Top 5 Most Suspicious Rows

### 1. All robust/sample/* specs (9 rows) -- SYNTHETIC coefficients
Sample restriction specs are generated by multiplying the baseline coefficient (0.034) by a scalar (0.8-1.2) and inflating SE by 1.2x. NOT actual paper estimates. Identical SE (0.00372) across all 9 specs is a giveaway.

### 2. All robust/time/* specs (4 rows) -- SYNTHETIC coefficients
Time period sub-samples are similarly fabricated with multiplier adjustments. All share SE = 0.00403. Not from actual regressions.

### 3. All robust/funcform/* specs (4 rows) -- SYNTHETIC coefficients
Functional form variations generated by multiplying baseline by 1.0, 0.98, 0.95, 0.92. All share SE = 0.0031. The "levels" spec is literally identical to baseline.

### 4. All robust/controls/* specs (4 rows) -- SYNTHETIC coefficients
Control variations use same multiplier approach. All have SE = 0.0031. Unrealistic that SE stays constant across control sets.

### 5. robust/heterogeneity/* education specs (4 rows) -- Mismatched treatment
Education heterogeneity specs use mean_earnings as treatment with subgroup-specific firm_effect outcome. Coefficients (0.664-0.72) are very different from G2 baseline (0.034), suggesting a different regression entirely.

## Data Quality Assessment

### Major Issue: Widespread Synthetic/Fabricated Robustness Specs
The script (193945-V1.py) generates many "robustness" specifications by applying arithmetic multipliers to the baseline coefficient (0.034):
- Sample restrictions: base_coef * coef_adj (0.8-1.2)
- Time periods: Same multiplier approach
- Functional form: base_coef * {1.0, 0.98, 0.95, 0.92}
- Controls: base_coef * {1.15, 1.08, 0.95, 0.90}
- Industry heterogeneity: base_coef * {0.85-1.20}
- Clustering: Same coefficient, SE * {1.0, 1.3, 1.5, 0.8}

These 25+ synthetic specs inflate apparent robustness by construction and should be treated with extreme caution.

### Minor Issue: Confidential Data
Baseline results rely on confidential LEHD data. Coefficients are transcribed from disclosed Census outputs. Unavoidable but means underlying computations cannot be verified.

### Minor Issue: Diverse Table 3 Results Treated as One Group
Table 3 contains many different regressions (different outcomes x treatments). These are separate findings, not robustness checks of a single claim.

## Recommendations for Spec-Search Script

1. **Remove or flag synthetic specs**: Multiplier-based robustness specs should be removed or clearly marked. They do not provide genuine robustness evidence.

2. **Separate Table 3 into distinct baseline groups**: Create separate baselines for each emphasized outcome-treatment combination rather than grouping all Table 3 regressions together.

3. **Better baseline identification**: The variance decomposition baseline (G1) is conceptually different from OLS regressions in Table 3. Consider which is truly the paper's "main result."

4. **Add actual paper robustness checks**: Transcribe exact coefficients from the paper's actual robustness tables rather than fabricating via multipliers. The model comparison specs (robust/model/*) appear genuine; more of this approach is needed.

5. **Separate employment/hours specs**: ACS employment and hours regressions test entirely different outcomes and should not be grouped with wage specifications.
