  "global_notes": "Paper is 'The Impacts of Microfinance: Evidence from Joint-Liability Lending in Mongolia' (AEJ-Applied). RCT design randomized at soum (sub-district) level in rural Mongolia. All specifications use ANCOVA framework: cross-sectional OLS at follow-up with baseline outcome control. Treatment is group loan assignment (vs. control). The custom/indiv_vs_control specs use individual loan treatment (a different treatment arm entirely) and are classified as non-core different-treatment. Several robust/outcome specs (enterprise, soleent, scaled_profit_r, ln_totalc, ln_foodc) are exact duplicates of the corresponding baselines. The robust/fe/soum_fe specification failed (n=0, empty coefficients) because soum FE absorbs the treatment variation (treatment was randomized at soum level). The winsorize specs (profit_r_wins) are core sample restrictions for the profit claim (G5) since they apply outlier treatment to the same profit variable. Some alternative outcomes (scaled_assets, hours_total, ln_nondurc, ln_durc) test different claims not covered by the baselines and are classified as non-core. There are 66 total specifications, of which 1 is invalid (soum_fe)."
