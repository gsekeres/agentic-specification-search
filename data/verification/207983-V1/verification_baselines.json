  "global_notes": "Paper: 'Contamination Bias in Multiple-Treatment Regressions' by Kolesar & Walters (AER). The main contribution is methodological (the multe decomposition). The STAR analysis is illustrative. Specification search focuses on the small class vs control comparison. 75 total specs including aide treatment and Benhassine et al. replication specs. The Benhassine specs (girls_only/boys_only with lct_father treatment) are from a different dataset entirely."
