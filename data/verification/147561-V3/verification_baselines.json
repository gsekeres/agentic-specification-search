Many specs are cross-products of a single robustness dimension with both outcomes, which is appropriate. run_009 (rc/fe/sets/stratum_month_house) and run_010 (revenues variant) are exact duplicates of baselines run_001 and run_002 since stratum_month_house IS the baseline FE set. run_050 (rc/fe/sets/stratum_only__revenues__diff_means) equals run_004 (diff_in_means__revenues) since stratum-only FE with diff-in-means on revenues produces identical results.",
