  "global_notes": "Pries and Rogerson (2021, AEJ: Macro). 74 specs total. Data issue: robust/sample/drop_year_2018 has identical coef and N to baseline (year-drop not implemented). Many heterogeneity specs (demographics, industry, state) are non-core. 11 alternative outcome specs measure different turnover concepts, non-core since baseline claim is specifically about oneqhazrate."
