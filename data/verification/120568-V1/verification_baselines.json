Not a causal study. 93% of specs negative, 88% significant at 5%. All alternative outcome measures show similar declining trends."

  "global_notes": "Descriptive/accounting paper documenting declining worker turnover. NOT a causal study -- no treatment or policy intervention. The time_trend coefficient captures the secular decline in short-duration employment spells. The decline is pervasive across demographics, industries, and geographies. Post-2010 the trend appears to have flattened. 5 permutation placebo tests all show non-significant coefficients, confirming the real trend."
