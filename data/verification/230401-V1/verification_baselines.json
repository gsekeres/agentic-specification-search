  "global_notes": "The paper studies racial discrimination across four minority groups but the primary focus is on Black-owned businesses (G1). Most robustness specifications (54 of 60) use black_50 as the treatment variable. The baseline spec_id is shared across all four groups (all labeled baseline). Three specs labeled robust/treatment/* re-run the baseline for hisp_50, asian_50, and native_50 and are effectively duplicates of the G2/G3/G4 baselines with slightly different N. One spec (robust/outcome/collval_num) has a missing p-value and near-zero coefficient, flagged as invalid. Placebo tests use predetermined outcomes (term, busage, ceoexp) and are clearly non-core."
