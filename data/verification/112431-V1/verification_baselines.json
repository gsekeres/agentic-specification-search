  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Electoral Accountability and Corruption' by Ferraz & Finan (AER 2011). Treatment is first-term status (binary). Primary outcome is pcorrupt (proportion of audited funds associated with corruption). The paper also includes RDD analysis using election margin as running variable. Placebo tests use predetermined characteristics. The 'no_polcheck_mills' spec has treatment 'capacity' not 'first' -- appears to be a data issue but is included as-is."
