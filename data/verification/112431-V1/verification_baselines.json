      "notes": "Two baseline specs: baseline is the no-FE specification (coef=-0.0188, p=0.047) and baseline_fe adds state fixed effects (coef=-0.0193, p=0.056). Both test the same claim with pcorrupt as outcome and first as treatment. The paper emphasizes the state-FE version as its main specification."

  "global_notes": "96 specifications total. The paper tests one core hypothesis (reelection incentives reduce corruption) using cross-sectional OLS. Alternative outcomes (ncorrupt, dcorrupt variants, pmismanagement) test related but distinct outcome concepts. Heterogeneity interactions test conditional effects, not the main effect. RDD specifications use a different identification strategy but test the same causal claim. The coefficient in inference-variation rows (58-63) is -0.01756, slightly different from both baselines, suggesting an intermediate control set was used."
