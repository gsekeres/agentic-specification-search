The paper's primary specification is Table 2 Column 1 with three-way clustering (country, product, year), but pyfixest does not support three-way clustering, so the baseline uses two-way clustering as reported in Table 2 Column 2. Coefficient: -3.617, SE: 0.692, p < 0.001, N = 95,905. The paper uses ppmlhdfe (Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood with high-dimensional fixed effects) to handle zero trade flows."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'The Empire Project: Trade Policy in Interwar Canada' by Lampe, O'Rourke, Reiter, and Yotov (Journal of International Economics, 2024). The specification search focuses on the main PPML gravity result from Table 2 -- the effect of Canadian tariffs (LN_TARIFF = ln(1 + ave_raw)) on import values. The paper has a single primary baseline group: the common tariff effect on trade. Heterogeneity analyses (Empire vs. non-Empire, Ottawa agreements, sector-by-sector, country-by-country, year-by-year) test the same relationship on subsamples or with interaction terms. The dataset was reconstructed from raw CSV files because the original Stata .dta files required Stata to build. This introduces potential minor discrepancies from the published results. A limitation is that pyfixest cannot replicate the original three-way clustering (country, product, year). Specs 29 and 53-60 failed due to convergence or collinearity issues; these are excluded from analysis. There are 65 specifications total, of which 53 converged. The 10 sector subsample specs use reduced FE (country*product + product*year) because the full three-way FE is too demanding for small sector subsamples."
