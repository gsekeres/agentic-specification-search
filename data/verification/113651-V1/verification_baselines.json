      "notes": "Table 5, Panel A. 12 baseline specifications: 3 samples (sample1=all retailers with price data at baseline+endline, sample2=targeted neighborhoods only, sample3=incumbent retailers in targeted neighborhoods) x 2 estimation methods (OLS_ITT using Hgt0, IV_2SLS instrumenting Hfgt0 with Hgt0) x 2 control sets (none, full controls including baseline prices, pre-treatment competition, province dummies, district demographics). This is the paper's central result. Coefficients range from -0.015 to -0.060. The ITT without controls on sample1 (spec 1, coef=-0.020, p=0.006) is the headline specification. IV estimates are roughly 2x the ITT magnitude, reflecting non-compliance. Some IV-with-controls specs lose significance (specs 4, 8, 12) due to larger standard errors from the combination of IV and many controls."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'The Causal Effect of Competition on Prices and Quality: Evidence from a Field Experiment' by Busso & Galiani (AEJ Applied 2018). This is a randomized field experiment in the Dominican Republic where the entry of new small retailers into local markets was randomly assigned. The paper's main finding is that competition from new entrants reduced incumbent retailers' prices by about 2% (ITT) or 4-6% (IV). There is a single baseline group (G1) because all 12 marked baselines test the same core claim (competition reduces prices on a weighted log price index) varying only the sample, estimation method, and controls -- all from Table 5 Panel A. The 130 non-baseline specifications explore: (1) robustness to control sets (core), (2) alternative price indices -- unweighted, non-barcode-change, winsorized, trimmed, level (core for same-outcome variants), (3) consumer-level price measures from Table 5 Panel B (core -- same claim, different dataset), (4) alternative treatment definitions from Table 7 using D_H_random_2 and D_H_random_3_4 (core -- same outcome, dose-response), (5) heterogeneous effects by SE type (core inference), (6) different outcomes entirely -- product switching (Table 4), service quality, clients, spillovers from Table 8 (non-core -- different claims), (7) urban interaction heterogeneity (non-core), (8) naive OLS without IV (core -- same outcome, alternative estimator). The experiment has 72 clusters (districts/mercados) across all samples. There are 211 total specifications, including 60 individual product-level price regressions (Appendix Table A7) and 9 pooled product-level regressions with product fixed effects (Table 6)."
