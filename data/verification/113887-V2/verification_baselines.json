The baseline specification includes treatment group indicators (ik, cash), a follow-up period dummy (fu), the DD interactions (ik_fu, cash_fu), and village-level controls (diconsa + month FEs). SEs clustered at the village level (id_loc). Groups 2 and 3 (in-kind with and without nutrition education) are pooled into a single 'in-kind' treatment arm."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Testing Paternalism: Cash versus In-Kind Transfers' by Cunha (AEJ: Applied Economics). The specification search focuses on the DD estimates from a village-level cluster-RCT in Mexico's PAL program. 208 rural villages were randomized to control, in-kind food transfers, in-kind + nutrition education, or cash + nutrition education. Groups 2 and 3 are pooled as a single 'in-kind' arm in the main analysis. There are 77 total specifications: 69 tracking the in-kind treatment (ik_fu) and 8 tracking the cash treatment (cash_fu). The primary coefficient of interest is ik_fu on pc_exp_total. The baseline specification shows p=0.065, but adding household-level controls brings this to p=0.026 (controls/full_baseline). Key mechanism results show the effect is driven by in-kind basket goods (outcome/pc_exp_inkind: coef=44.32, p<0.001) with negligible effects on non-in-kind food (outcome/pc_exp_n_inkind: coef=-2.81, p=0.856), supporting the 'extra-marginal' consumption interpretation. Outcome decomposition specs (food, nonfood, inkind, non-inkind) are classified as core because they directly test the paper's main claim about the composition of the consumption response. Disaggregated item-level specs (individual food items, nonfood subcategories) are classified as non-core. Placebo tests, heterogeneity splits, and cash treatment outcome decompositions are also non-core. Three placebo specs use the baseline cross-sectional difference (treatment variable 'ik' without interaction) and thus have a different treatment variable structure; they are classified as non-core placebos."
