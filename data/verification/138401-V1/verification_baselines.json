  "global_notes": "Large-sample study using ACS 2000-2017 (16M observations). Treatment is simplified from original paper's approach (median split of states by pre-vaccine measles rates vs. continuous intensity). Negative coefficients are unexpected given the hypothesis that vaccination improves outcomes. This may reflect measurement issues with the simplified treatment. 84% of specs significant due to massive sample size. Placebo test with random treatment appropriately shows no effect."
