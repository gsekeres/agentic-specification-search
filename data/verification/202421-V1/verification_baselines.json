  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Who Watches the Watchmen?' by Mastrorocco & Ornaghi (AEJ: Policy). The specification search focuses on Table 4 (Google Trends) since Tables 1-3 and 5 require proprietary data. The Google Trends results are secondary evidence; the paper's primary claims rest on content analysis (Table 1) and crime clearance rates (Table 2). The baseline Google Trends coefficients are negative but not statistically significant. Weather and YouTube outcomes serve as placebo tests (should show no effect). The baselines for weather (baseline/google_trends/weather) and youtube (baseline/google_trends/youtube) are classified as placebo specs, not separate baseline groups. Some specs appear duplicated: baseline/google_trends/crime = did/controls/full/crime; baseline/google_trends/police = did/controls/full/police; did/controls/none/police = did/controls/none_dma_ym/police; did/fe/unit_only/police = did/fe/unit_only/police_ctrl; did/fe/year_instead_month/police appears twice (rows 23 and 63). There are 63 total specifications."
