  "global_notes": "This paper has many baseline specifications across multiple outcomes and subsamples (white vs black students). The two headline findings are (1) reduced racial prejudice for white students (G1) and (2) improved academic performance for black students (G2). Robustness checks primarily vary controls and sample restrictions for these two main claims. Note: the inference variation specs for GPA_black have a different coefficient than the Table 4 GPA baseline because they use Residence FE only rather than Residence + Program FE."
