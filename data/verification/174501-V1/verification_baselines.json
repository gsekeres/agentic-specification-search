  "global_notes": "No changes to baseline group assignments relative to the surface. The surface correctly identified three baseline groups: G1 (racial stereotypes/IAT), G2 (academic performance), G3 (social outcomes). Sample restriction specs (full_sample_with_race_fe, restrict_white_black_only, restrict_black_only) are classified as noncore_population_change because they change the target population from the baseline race subsample. LOO control specs were run only for one focal outcome per group (DscoreraceIAT for G1, GPA for G2, PCAfriend for G3) rather than multiplicatively across all outcomes, which is a reasonable choice given budget constraints."
