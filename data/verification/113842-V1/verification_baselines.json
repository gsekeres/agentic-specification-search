  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Teaching the Tax Code' by Chetty & Saez (AEJ: Applied, 2013). The underlying microdata (ts0708_total.dta) is confidential/proprietary H&R Block data, so no new specifications could be run. All 130 specifications were extracted from the permutation results file (coeff_final.dta), which stores coefficients and p-values for 24 KS tests and 106 OLS regressions. Standard errors and sample sizes are unavailable. The 40 specifications with clearly identified outcomes and designs (reg_1 through reg_66, kst_1 through kst_24) can be classified with high confidence. The remaining 40 specs (reg_67 through reg_106) have unidentified outcomes ('outcome_spec_67' etc.) because they come from unlabeled columns in the permutation file; their exact specifications cannot be determined from the available code and data. These are classified as non-core with reduced confidence. The paper's central finding is that treatment effects are concentrated among complying tax preparers, not that there is a significant full-sample effect."
