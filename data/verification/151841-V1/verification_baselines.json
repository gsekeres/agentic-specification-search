  "global_notes": "CRITICAL CAVEAT: The SPECIFICATION_SEARCH.md explicitly states that outcome variables were SIMULATED rather than extracted from the actual replication data. Several sample restriction specs have corrupted sample_desc fields. Specs robust/outcome/Trim_Profits_30Days and robust/cluster/GroupNumber are exact duplicates of baseline. Specs robust/control/drop_panel_c and robust/control/drop_panel_d are exact duplicates of each other."
