  "global_notes": "This paper has three main claims corresponding to three outcome families: test scores (G1), teacher turnover (G2), and headmaster replacement (G3). The single 'baseline' spec in the CSV only covers test scores, but the paper treats teacher and headmaster turnover as equally important findings. No fixed effects are used (RD design). All specifications use the same treatment variable (pX_dummy = party turnover at RD cutoff). Some specs are exact duplicates of each other (e.g., baseline = rd/bandwidth/optimal_both_score = robust/outcome/both_score_4_std). Additional outcomes (dropout rate, 8th grade scores, lefttchr) appear as alternative outcome checks. Placebo tests use either non-municipal schools or fake RD cutoffs. All coefficients and SEs are present and finite."
