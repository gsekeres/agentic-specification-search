  "global_notes": "Paper is 'How Punishment Severity Affects Jury Verdicts' by Bindler and Hjalmarsson (AEJ:EP). Uses 206,733 case-defendant observations from Old Bailey Proceedings Online, 1715-1900; main analysis uses ~105K observations (1803-1871). The DiD exploits staggered abolition of capital punishment across offense categories. Key concern: only 26 clusters for clustering (paper addresses with wild bootstrap). The effect is driven primarily by violent/sex offenses (coef=0.22) rather than property offenses (coef=0.015). Age controls substantially reduce sample and effect. There are 69 total specifications."
