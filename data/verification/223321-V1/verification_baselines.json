The papers preferred specification is baseline (full controls), which yields an insignificant coefficient (p=0.10). The no-controls and basic-controls baselines are significant but largely driven by confounding through intermarriage."

  "global_notes": "The paper tests whether parents age at arrival affects childs Hispanic identification. The core claim is sensitive to controls: significant without intermarriage controls but insignificant with full controls. 62 total specs. Heterogeneity interaction specs change the treatment variable to an interaction term and are non-core. The placebo uses a different outcome. Logit/probit are core_method but different scale. Alternative treatment cutoffs test the same concept."
