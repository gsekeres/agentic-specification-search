  "global_notes": "Paper: Effect of Parent's Age at Arrival on Child's Hispanic Identity (AER P&P 2025). WLS with Census/ACS data (N=281,076). The key finding is that the raw effect (1.1pp) drops to 0.14pp and becomes insignificant when intermarriage is controlled. This suggests the mechanism is through marriage patterns rather than direct cultural transmission. The paper presents 3 baselines: no controls, basic controls, and full controls. The full controls spec is the preferred one. Placebo test on parent's own identity is significant (0.18pp), which is a concern. Heterogeneity by parent gender is stark (strong for fathers, null for mothers). 62 total specs."
