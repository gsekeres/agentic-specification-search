  "global_notes": "This paper uses a regression discontinuity design at the village population threshold of 1000 in Uttar Pradesh, India. Villages above this threshold were assigned as standalone Gram Panchayats (solo GPs), while smaller villages were grouped into multi-village GPs. The paper reports results from two delimitation episodes: 1991 (Table 2, amenities/education outcomes) and 2011 (Table 3, welfare programs and NREGS). The 15 baselines include 5 main index outcomes (groups G1-G5) plus 10 additional outcomes (individual school variables, BPL cards, health insurance, pensions, electricity, person-days, labor expenditure) that are baseline-only without dedicated robustness specs. The 5 main index outcomes have 171 associated robustness/sensitivity specifications across bandwidth, polynomial order, kernel, donut hole, sample restriction, clustering, control progression, functional form, alternative outcomes/treatments, placebo tests, and heterogeneity analyses."
