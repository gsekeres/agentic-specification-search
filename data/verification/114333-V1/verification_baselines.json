  "global_notes": "This paper studies team vs individual play in repeated PD. The core claim is about the average cooperation rate difference (is_team -> cooperate). The specification search also includes defection timing outcomes (coop_end_round on a different dataset), alternative game-theoretic outcomes (mutual_coop, mutual_defect, got_suckered, temptation, payoff), a placebo with fake_team treatment, and extensive heterogeneity by block and round. The defection timing analysis uses a different dataset and outcome concept, so it is classified as non-core. Many heterogeneity specs restrict to single blocks or rounds, testing subgroup effects rather than the average treatment effect."
