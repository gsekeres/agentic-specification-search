  "global_notes": "Well-structured RCT specification search. 8 baselines correspond to main table (composite + 7 sub-indices). Most robustness specs target G1. Full-controls variants for sub-indices target G2. Individual PHQ items (phq_1 through phq_9) use raw depression items where negative coefficients indicate improvement. Some treatment variation specs change the treatment variable (cash_vs_control uses b_treat_largecash; any_vs_control uses any_treatment), which changes the causal object."
