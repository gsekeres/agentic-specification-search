Columns V (pair + donor-year FE) and VI (pair FE + macro controls) are alternative FE structures for the same claim. All three are significant at 5%. Columns VII-IX (run_004, run_005, run_006) use a different treatment variable (p_unvotes_rt_elecex = real-time UN votes decomposition) and are classified as noncore_alt_treatment despite being labeled as baseline specs in the surface."

  "global_notes": "Baseline group assignment is adjusted relative to the surface. The surface listed baseline__main_colVII, colVIII, colIX as baseline specs, but these use p_unvotes_rt_elecex (real-time unvotes decomposition interacted with elections) as the treatment variable rather than p_unvotes_elecex (standard unvotes interacted with elections). Since the treatment concept changes, these three are reclassified as noncore_alt_treatment. This is consistent with the surface's own explore/treatment/decompose_unvotes_rt_resid specification. Three specs duplicate the baseline identically (rc/fe/pair_plus_year, rc/sample/subset/balanced_panel, rc/joint/balanced_panel_pair_year) because the baseline already uses pair+year FE and the panel is already balanced."
