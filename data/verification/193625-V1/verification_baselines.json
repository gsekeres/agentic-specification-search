The paper also examines tier-level heterogeneity, but the primary estimand is the overall average DiD effect."

  "global_notes": "86 total specifications. 5 have missing/NaN coefficients due to collinearity or ill-defined single-arm samples (cz_x_cohort, pre_recession_cohorts, post_recession_cohorts, severe_cz_only, mild_cz_only). 10 heterogeneity interaction specifications change the treatment variable to an interaction term and are not direct tests of the core claim. 2 placebo specifications use fake treatment timing. 11 alternative outcome specifications use different income distribution measures. The core claim is well-supported with many valid robustness checks across controls, samples, FE structures, inference methods, and functional forms."
