Primary baseline is childmarriage outcome (Table4-PanelA-Col1, coef=-0.0077, p=0.003). Three additional baselines use alternative outcomes from same table: marriage_age (Col2, coef=+0.123, p=0.009), educ (Col4, coef=+0.045, p=0.023), employed (Col5, coef=-0.009, p=0.002). All four are explicitly listed in the surface as baseline specs. The alternative-outcome baselines change the outcome concept but are part of the paper's multi-outcome claim object."
