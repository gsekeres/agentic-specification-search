  "global_notes": "This paper has a single core claim (ITT effect of IDA on homeownership). 80 total specifications. Heterogeneity specs (rows 40-50) use interaction terms changing the estimand. Placebo tests (rows 59-63) use different outcome variables. Row 42 (treat x race_cau) has coefficient 0.0 and empty p-value due to no variation in race_cau. Row 39 (LPM no controls) is identical to row 2 (bivariate)."
