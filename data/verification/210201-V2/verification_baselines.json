  "global_notes": "This is a structural calibration paper (Hong and Rios-Rull, AER 2012). The specification search constructs reduced-form regressions of PSID microdata examining gender-specific marital transition probabilities. The paper's primary contribution is a life-cycle model, not reduced-form estimation. The 'treatment' variable (female) is demographic rather than a policy intervention. Specs 1 and 5 are algebraic complements (divorce = 1 - stay_married), so they are grouped together in G1. Many specifications change the treatment variable (e.g., child94, dep94, age_94, q) or the outcome variable (delta_dep, delta_child, etc.), which fundamentally change the estimand. The divorce result (G1) is extremely robust but near-zero; the widowhood result (G3) is strongly significant across all specifications."
