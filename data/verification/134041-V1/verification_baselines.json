Rows 58-62 (robust/outcome/*) exactly duplicate the G2 baselines with identical coefficients and p-values. Rows 63-66 (z_mani_index, large, problem, govmore) test the manipulation check / first-stage effect, which is a different claim than policy demand. Row 70 (cluster by wave) has an implausibly small p-value (1.87e-08) from clustering on only 2 wave groups. Row 83 (placebo/republican) has coefficient ~2.65e-16 likely due to multicollinearity with democrat+indep+otherpol."
