Baseline z_lmpolicy_index is significant at 5% but individual policy components show mixed significance. 97.8% of specs positive. Leave-one-out analysis very stable. Heterogeneity reveals differential effects by partisanship (Democrats respond more). Placebo tests on predetermined characteristics pass."
