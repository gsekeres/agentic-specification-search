## Baseline Groups

### G1: Composite policy demand index
- **Claim**: Information about the gender wage gap (T1) increases demand for labor market policy (composite z-scored index).
- **Baseline spec_ids**: baseline (outcome_var=z_lmpolicy_index)
- **Baseline coefficient**: 0.062, p=0.014, n=3031
- **Expected sign**: positive

### G2: Individual policy items
- **Claim**: Information about the gender wage gap (T1) increases support for specific labor market policies.
- **Baseline spec_ids**: baseline (outcome_var in {quotaanchor, AAanchor, legislationanchor, transparencyanchor, childcare})
- **Baseline coefficients**: Range from 0.003 (childcare, p=0.94) to 0.123 (AAanchor, p=0.001)
- **Expected sign**: positive

## Top 5 Most Suspicious Rows

### 1. Rows 58-62 (robust/outcome/{quotaanchor,AAanchor,legislationanchor,transparencyanchor,childcare})
- **Issue**: These 5 rows are exact duplicates of the 5 individual-item baselines (rows 2-6). The coefficients and p-values are identical to the penny. They were generated by the script looping over "alternative outcomes" that included the same outcomes already used as baselines. They add no new information.
- **Classification**: invalid (duplicate)

### 2. Row 70 (robust/cluster/wave)
- **Issue**: Clustering by wave with only 2 clusters produces an implausibly small p-value (1.87e-08) for the same point estimate (0.062). With 2 clusters, cluster-robust inference is unreliable and the p-value is meaningless.
- **Classification**: invalid

### 3. Row 83 (robust/placebo/predetermined_republican)
- **Issue**: The coefficient is essentially zero (2.65e-16), which is machine precision zero. This is likely because "republican" is linearly determined by the other political affiliation indicators (democrat, indep, otherpol) that are included as controls, causing near-perfect multicollinearity.
- **Classification**: invalid

### 4. Rows 63-66 (robust/outcome/{z_mani_index,large,problem,govmore})
- **Issue**: These are manipulation check / first-stage outcomes ("is the wage gap large?", "is it a problem?", "should government do more?"). They test a fundamentally different claim (perception updating) than the baseline claim (policy demand). The very large coefficients (0.42-1.44) and tiny p-values reflect the first stage, not the policy demand effect.
- **Classification**: noncore_alt_outcome

### 5. Rows 71-76 (robust/het/interaction_*)
- **Issue**: These specifications include interaction terms (T1 x gender, T1 x democrat, etc.) which change the meaning of the T1 main-effect coefficient from ATE to the effect conditional on the interaction variable being zero. The reported coefficient is not comparable to the baseline ATE.
- **Classification**: noncore_heterogeneity

## Notes on Non-Unique spec_id

All 6 baseline rows share spec_id="baseline". They can only be distinguished by outcome_var. This is a design issue in the specification search script: baseline specs for different outcomes should have unique spec_ids (e.g., "baseline_z_lmpolicy_index", "baseline_quotaanchor", etc.).

---

## Recommendations for the Specification Search Script

1. **Assign unique spec_ids to baselines**: The 6 baseline rows all share spec_id="baseline". Each should have a unique identifier incorporating the outcome variable name.

2. **Remove duplicate outcome rows**: Rows 58-62 exactly replicate the individual-item baselines. The loop generating "alternative outcomes" should exclude outcomes already used as baselines.

3. **Remove or flag the wave-clustered specification**: Clustering by wave with only 2 clusters is not valid inference. Either remove it or flag it as a diagnostic.

4. **Separate manipulation checks from policy outcomes**: The z_mani_index/large/problem/govmore outcomes test a different theoretical claim (belief updating) and should be clearly labeled as "first_stage" or "manipulation_check" rather than lumped with robustness checks on the main claim.

5. **Handle the republican placebo more carefully**: The republican variable is collinear with democrat+indep+otherpol. Either drop it from the placebo set or remove the collinear controls before running the placebo regression.

6. **Clarify heterogeneity specs**: The interaction specifications report the T1 main effect, but with interactions included, this coefficient has a different interpretation (effect when the interacted variable = 0). To preserve comparability, the script should either report marginal effects at the mean or clearly label these as non-comparable.
