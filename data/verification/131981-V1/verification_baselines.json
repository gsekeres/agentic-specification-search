  "global_notes": "Single baseline group G1 confirmed, matching the surface exactly. No adjustments to baseline-group assignments. All 45 specification_results.csv rows belong to G1. The surface core_universe explicitly includes rc/form/outcome/* and rc/joint/outcome_*/* specs; alternative mental health indices (z_somatic, z_nonsomatic, sum_srq) are treated as measures of the same outcome concept (mental distress from curfew). All 45 rows are valid and core. One minor metadata note: for rc/joint/bw_poly/* rows, the design.regression_discontinuity.poly_order field in coefficient_vector_json records 1 (the template default) rather than 2, while the joint.details.poly_order field correctly records 2 and the executed coefficients match local-quadratic run012 exactly, confirming correct execution. Inference variants appear only in inference_results.csv (2 rows) as required; no infer/* rows are present in specification_results.csv.",

The surface designates run001 as the primary baseline; runs 002-004 anchor the other bandwidth columns from Table 4. bw17 is not significant due to low power (N=486); bw45 and bw60 are significant. The design block in coefficient_vector_json (poly_order=1 template) is consistent for bw_poly joint rows where the actual poly_order=2 is recorded only in joint.details; execution is verified correct."
