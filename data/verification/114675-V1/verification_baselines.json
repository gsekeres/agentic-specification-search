  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Mafia in the Ballot Box' by De Feo and De Luca (AEJ: Economic Policy). Uses 370 Sicilian municipalities over 12 parliamentary elections (1946-1992). The identification strategy exploits historical Mafia presence (1900 parliamentary inquiry) as an instrument for contemporary Mafia activity (1987 measure) interacted with a time trend. Both IV and OLS results are reported; OLS serves as a lower bound due to likely attenuation bias. The OLS baseline with investment controls (baseline/ols/DC_VV/invest) shows a negative R2 (-1.0), indicating a problematic specification -- this OLS variant is treated cautiously. The paper also tests Mafia1994 as an alternative treatment measure, decade-specific effects, and Mafia x communism interactions. Falsification tests using MSI-PRI (right-wing) vote differentials show no significant Mafia effect. There are 139 total specifications across both outcomes."
