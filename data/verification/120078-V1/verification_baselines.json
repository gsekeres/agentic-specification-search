Col 4: + block FE + controls (coef=-0.034). All highly significant. The discrimination effect ranges from 3.4% to 16.9% depending on controls."

  "global_notes": "Paper studies ethnic discrimination on Airbnb using host name ethnicity. 77 total specs. 97% significant at 5%. The negative coefficient (minority price penalty) is extremely robust across all specification choices. Only 1 out of 77 specs shows a positive coefficient. City-level clustering weakens but does not eliminate significance."
