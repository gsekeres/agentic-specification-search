  "global_notes": "Surface defined one baseline group (G1). All 53 executed rows belong to G1. No adjustment to baseline-group assignments was needed. The surface listed 'design/difference_in_differences/estimator/twfe' in core_universe.design_spec_ids but it was not executed as a standalone row; the TWFE design is captured inside the 'baseline' row's coefficient_vector_json design block. The 5 alt-outcome baseline rows (baseline__sport_hrs, baseline__oweight, baseline__kommheard, baseline__kommgotten, baseline__kommused) are explicitly listed in the surface's core_universe.baseline_spec_ids but measure different outcome concepts from the G1 focal claim (sportsclub membership). Per instructions, outcome-concept drift overrides to noncore_alt_outcome (is_core_test=0). The 3 sportsclub baseline rows (baseline, baseline__sportsclub_col1, baseline__sportsclub_col2) are core_method with is_core_test=1.",
