Non-core specs include MS treatment arm, average/Chinese score outcomes, Big Five personality, peer effects (different treatment var: deskmate_baseline_score), and upper-track results. Only specs varying controls/clustering/sample/funcform/method while keeping MSR on math_score_endline for lower-track students are core tests."
