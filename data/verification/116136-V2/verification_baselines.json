      "notes": "Four baseline specs represent progressive control additions (Age+Year, +Children, +State, +Marriage duration). baseline/full is the preferred specification with all controls. All use Individual FE and state clustering. The first three baselines are marginally insignificant (p~0.063-0.068) while baseline/full is significant (p=0.003) due to the addition of marriage duration controls restricting the sample."

  "global_notes": "Paper studies effect of unilateral divorce on assets, interacted with property division regime. The main treatment uni_comprop is an interaction of unilateral divorce adoption with community property regime. Several specifications have null/missing coefficients because the treatment variable was collinear or dropped in restricted subsamples. The functional form specs (log, IHS) show negative signs, contradicting the baseline. The first-difference specification shows a large negative and highly significant coefficient, which is a major concern for the baseline claim."
