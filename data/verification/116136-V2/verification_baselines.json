  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Yours, Mine and Ours: Do Divorce Laws Affect the Intertemporal Behavior of Married Couples?' by Alessandra Voena (AER 2015). The main treatment is the interaction of unilateral divorce adoption with community property regime (uni_comprop). All 66 specs use assets as the outcome except 2 alternative outcomes (has_positive_assets, assets_quintile) and 2 transformed outcomes (log_assets, ihs_assets). Some specs have empty coefficients due to convergence failures (late_period, eqdistr_only, title_only, age_older, 1980s, 1990s). The first-differenced spec (panel/method/first_diff) shows a negative coefficient with p=0.0, which may reflect a computational issue. There are 4 baseline variants differing only in control sets: baseline (age+year), baseline/children (age+year+children), baseline/state_controls (+state dummies), baseline/full (full controls including marriage duration). Only baseline/full achieves p<0.05."
