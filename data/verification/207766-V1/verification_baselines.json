  "global_notes": "The paper has 4 baseline rows (congr1, congr2, congr3, total) but the core hypothesis is about congruent org transfers (congr1). The moderate (congr2) and non-congruent (congr3) outcomes serve as falsification/contrast tests where a null effect is expected. Many specs run all 4 outcomes together, so the CSV has groups of 4 rows with the same spec_id. Only the congr1 and total rows are treated as core tests. Heterogeneity splits (campaign spending, turnout, incumbency, municipality size) are classified as non-core because they test effect moderation rather than the main claim. Single-year regressions are classified as diagnostics. The spec search correctly identifies the RD as the method and the treatment is the sharp cutoff at alignm=0."
