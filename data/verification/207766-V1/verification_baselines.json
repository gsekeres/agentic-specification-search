  "global_notes": "Paper: 'Organized Voters' by Camille Urvoy (AER 2025). Sharp RD design using French municipal elections. The running variable (alignm) is the win margin of the ruling party candidate. Many specifications apply the same spec_id to 4 different outcomes (congr1_3, congr2_3, congr3_3, total), so unique IDs are constructed as spec_id__outcome_var. The primary claim is about congruent organizations (G1); null results for moderate/non-congruent orgs support the specificity of the finding. Specs with different cutoffs (placebo) test RD validity. Heterogeneity specs test where the effect is concentrated."
