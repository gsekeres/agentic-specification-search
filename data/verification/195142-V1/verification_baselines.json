Positive sign expected since higher reform values correspond to subsidy rate cuts reducing receipts. Paper main claim uses confidential BHP data for manufacturing employment; this is a secondary public-data outcome."

  "global_notes": "Critical limitation: Paper primary finding concerns manufacturing employment effects using confidential BHP data not in replication package. All 68 specs use county-level aggregates only. Several specs are exact duplicates of baseline (did/fe/state_year, robust/cluster/amr, robust/control/none, robust/outcome/grw_total all reproduce identical results). Treatment variables robust/treatment/small, medium, and large produce identical coefficients suggesting a coding issue where size-specific treatments were not properly constructed."
