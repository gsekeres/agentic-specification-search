  "global_notes": "Paper is Barrera-Osorio, Bertrand, Linden & Perez-Calle (2011) 'Improving the Design of Conditional Transfer Programs: Evidence from a Randomized Education Experiment in Colombia' (AEJ: Applied Economics). The study is an RCT in Bogota with three treatment arms: T1 (basic CCT with payments conditional on attendance), T2 (savings treatment with portion of transfer withheld for re-enrollment), and T3 (tertiary treatment offered in Suba locality only). Two main outcomes: monitored attendance (at_msamean, survey-selected students) and administrative enrollment (m_enrolled, all eligible students). Six baselines correspond to Tables 3-4 of the paper: T1 and T2 effects on attendance (G1, G2), T1 and T2 effects on enrollment (G3, G4), and T3 effects on attendance and enrollment in Suba (G5, G6). The G4 baseline is a documented null result (T1 has no enrollment effect). The specification search generates 89 total specifications across 10 categories. The winsorized attendance spec (funcform/winsorize_5_95/attendance_T1) is an exact duplicate of baseline_attendance_T1 because attendance is already bounded in [0,1] and winsorization at 5th/95th percentiles does not change any values. The z-score attendance spec (funcform/zscore/attendance_T1) has the same t-statistic and p-value as the baseline because z-scoring is a linear transformation."
