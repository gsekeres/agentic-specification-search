Cols 2 and 4 use decomposed road-type distances (dmichpav, dmichunp, dmichwat) instead of aggregate distance, so the treatment variable differs but tests the same relationship. Cols 3 and 4 add population controls. The international dummy coefficient (~0.068) is consistently significant across all four columns (p < 0.001)."

  "global_notes": "This paper (Porteous, AER 2019) estimates bilateral trade costs from a dynamic structural model of African agricultural markets and then uses reduced-form OLS to understand the determinants of those structurally-estimated costs. The 70 specifications span 5 baseline groups: (G1) overland trade cost determinants (Table 5, 4 baselines + 33 robustness), (G2) international link trade cost determinants (Table 6, 5 baselines + 13 robustness), (G3) port-to-world trade cost determinants (Table A13, 2 baselines + 4 robustness), (G4) elasticity of substitution (1 baseline + 4 robustness), and (G5) elasticity of demand (1 baseline + 3 robustness). The overland distance-trade cost relationship (G1) is highly robust: 89% of 37 specifications show a positive distance coefficient and 81% are significant at 5%. International link results (G2) are uniformly insignificant for distance but show a significant FTA effect. Port results (G3) lack power with N=47. Demand parameters (G4-G5) are sensitive to fixed effects and IV."
