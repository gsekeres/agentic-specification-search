  "global_notes": "Single baseline group. The paper's core finding about cesarean section convergence uses restricted NHDS data not available in the replication package. The specification search operates on the available vital statistics data, testing Apgar score convergence (Table 9) and related outcomes from Table C-2. The baseline result (p=0.028) is moderately significant but the positive sign suggests states diverge from national Apgar means after adoption -- contrary to the convergence hypothesis. The result is sensitive to fixed effects specification (disappears without state trends) and sample period (driven by full panel, not subperiods). The vital2 dataset provides additional Table C-2 specifications with different outcome variables (logapgar5, good2, log_nn28) and treatment (ln_stand_cs)."
