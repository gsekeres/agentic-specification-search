  "global_notes": "Clean specification search with 55 specs. One clear baseline. The spec search includes several categories of non-core tests: alternative outcomes (pregnant served, child served, TB check, diarrhea incidence, vaccination schedule), alternative treatment arms (financial incentive, mission+bonus, social recognition placebo), heterogeneity subsamples (community size terciles), and conditional-on-visit outcomes. Two specs appear to be exact duplicates (robust/weights/unweighted and robust/method/tabA4_unweighted have identical coefficients). The heterogeneity interaction specs (26-31) report the main treatment coefficient while adding interaction controls, making them interpretable as controls variations. The community size tercile splits (49-51) and baseline-performance splits (8-9) are sample splits that test the effect in subgroups; the former are classified as heterogeneity because they split the sample along a dimension the paper highlights as showing differential effects, while the latter are classified as core sample restrictions because they test whether the effect holds across performance groups."
