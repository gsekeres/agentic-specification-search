  "global_notes": "This is an empirical panel fixed effects paper studying the deregulation of U.S. nuclear power plants. The specification search produces 86 specifications exploring fixed effects structure, control variables, clustering alternatives, sample restrictions (state, region, temporal, reactor), heterogeneity analyses (reactor type, manufacturer, vintage, sale vs transfer, wholesale price), consolidation controls, outcome transformations, monthly decomposition, subsample splits, trimming/winsorization, and time trend alternatives. The main finding is highly robust: 100% of core specifications with power as outcome show a positive divestiture effect, and 93.8% are significant at 5%. The plant-level aggregation spec is excluded from the core set because it changes the unit of analysis and creates fractional treatment values that attenuate the coefficient."
