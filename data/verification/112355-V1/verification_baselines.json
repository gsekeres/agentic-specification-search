  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Product Creation and Destruction: Evidence and Price Implications' by Broda & Weinstein (AER 2010). The specification search focuses on Table 7, which uses publicly available panel data (EXTDISCOM.dta, 123 product groups x 16 quarters). Tables 1-6 and 8-9 require proprietary ACNielsen scanner data and cannot be replicated. The remaining 6 baseline specs (baseline/extens_expansion, baseline/dissap_expansion, baseline/net_expansion, baseline/extens_contraction, baseline/dissap_contraction, baseline/net_contraction) are Table 7 columns 4-9, which split the sample by expansions vs contractions. These are classified as core sample restrictions rather than separate baseline groups because they test the same relationship on subsamples. The food CPI analysis (specs food/*) uses a different dataset (Food_rc_cpi.dta) testing a distinct claim about CPI bias, so these are classified as non-core (different outcome/analysis). Some specs are exact duplicates: functional/quadratic = controls/fe_quadratic, functional/abs_total_treat = treatment/abs_total, functional/net_quadratic = controls/net_fe_quadratic. The spec controls/net_controlling_common has a coefficient of ~1.0 with essentially zero SE, which is a mechanical identity (NET + COMMON = TOTAL, so controlling for COMMON makes the TOTAL coefficient exactly 1). There are 93 total specifications."
