The expected sign based on the paper's hypothesis is negative (flood reduces Black share), but the baseline specification shows a positive coefficient. County and year FE are included. Many control variations (lagged DV) failed to produce results."

  ],
  "global_notes": "Paper is 'When the Levee Breaks' (AER). The baseline specification yields a positive, insignificant coefficient, contrary to expectations. Many specifications (7 of 57) produced missing results due to data issues with lagged dependent variables. Cross-sectional specifications (1930, 1950, 1960, 1970) show large positive coefficients because they capture level differences rather than within-county changes. The two-way FE specification (county + year) yields a negative coefficient (-0.072). Results are highly sensitive to FE structure."
