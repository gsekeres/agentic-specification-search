This is a legitimate collinearity issue. Focal parameter changed from f_int_1950 (surface plan) to f_int_1940 because equipment data unavailable at 1950. 12 of 37 G2 specs failed for similar collinearity reasons. Runner documented this clearly in SPECIFICATION_SEARCH.md deviation notes."

    "Two baseline groups (G1, G2) are coherent: G1 tests the labor/migration channel, G2 tests the capital/mechanization channel. Both share the same treatment, design, and population but differ in outcome.",
    "The runner ran most RC variations in pairs (one with geo+lags controls, one with geo+lags+ND controls), which creates duplicate spec_ids within groups. These are distinct specifications with different control sets, not true duplicates.",
    "G2 focal parameter was changed from f_int_1950 to f_int_1940 due to data availability constraints. This is a reasonable deviation documented in SPECIFICATION_SEARCH.md.",
    "Conley spatial SEs (6 rows) report point estimates but no standard errors due to pyfixest limitations. These are partial results.",
    "LOO spec 'drop_tenancy_mfg' in G1 is redundant: baseline 2 (geo+lags+ND) does not include tenancy/mfg controls, so dropping them changes nothing. The result is identical to baseline 2. Similarly, LOO 'drop_new_deal' in G1 is identical to baseline 1."
