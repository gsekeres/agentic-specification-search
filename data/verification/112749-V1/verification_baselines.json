Additional baselines include New Deal controls variant (run_0002), alternative outcome lnpopulation_black (runs 0007-0008), and Table 1 cross-sectional long-difference baselines (runs 0025-0030) which use flood_intensity as treatment in a cross-sectional design. The failed baselines for lnpopulation (run_0013) and lnfracfarms_nonwhite (runs 0019-0020) are due to matrix singularity."

High failure rate (14 of 26 specs) due to matrix singularity in sparse agricultural census panel. The lntractors outcome shows the strongest positive result (coef=0.51, p=0.001). Equipment value baseline (_nd variant, run_0037) has near-zero coefficient (coef=-0.0006, p=0.994), suggesting this outcome is not robust."

  "global_notes": "Surface defined two baseline groups: G1 (labor/population outcomes) and G2 (capital/agricultural outcomes). No changes to baseline-group assignments from the surface. 56 specifications total (30 G1, 26 G2). 31 succeeded and 25 failed, all due to matrix singularity from collinear time-interacted controls. G1 results are strongly robust with consistent negative coefficients for Black population share. G2 results are mixed: tractor adoption shows strong positive effects, but equipment value and other capital measures show weak or null effects. The rc/inference/hc1_* specs (runs 0006, 0012, 0018, 0024) are effectively inference variants placed in specification_results.csv rather than inference_results.csv; they duplicate the coefficient from their corresponding baseline but with HC1 robust SEs. The Table 1 cross-sectional baselines (runs 0025-0030) use a different design (long difference, cross-sectional) from the main panel specifications."
