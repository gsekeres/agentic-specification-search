  "global_notes": "Surface defined two baseline groups matching the paper's two main claims: (G1) flood reduced Black population share, (G2) flood increased farm mechanization. No changes to baseline group assignments from the pre-run surface. 46 specifications were planned (23 per group). 36 succeeded and 10 failed due to matrix singularity, primarily in G2 where the sparser agricultural census panel creates collinearity issues. All successful G1 specs yield negative coefficients. All successful G2 specs with f_int_1940 focal yield positive coefficients. The G2 f_int_1930 pre-trend check is correctly null (p=0.796). Inference variants (HC1 robust and state-level clustering) all succeed and preserve significance for both groups."
