  "global_notes": "This is a well-executed RCT from Allcott, Gentzkow, and Song (2022) in the AER. The specification search explored 65 total specs. The majority (55 specs) focus on the Bonus treatment (G1), with only 4 specs directly testing the Limit treatment (G2). Heterogeneity analyses (12 specs) report interaction coefficients and conditional main effects that are not directly comparable to the unconditional treatment effect baselines. Alternative outcomes (individual apps, SWB, addiction index, SMS index, different time periods) test distinct claims and are classified as non-core. Three placebo tests confirm randomization balance. Sample restriction specs (by demographics, winsorization, trimming) are classified as core because they estimate the same treatment effect on subpopulations or with different outlier handling."
