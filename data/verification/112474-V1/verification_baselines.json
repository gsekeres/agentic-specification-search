  "global_notes": "Surface-driven run. Both baseline groups match the pre-run surface exactly. No adjustments needed. Run numbers 41-42 are skipped (likely reserved for inference variants or diagnostics computed separately). The rc/estimation/ols_reduced_form specs use a nonstandard namespace and report treatment_var=T while the focal coefficient is actually on mean_grad_new (the instrument); this is a metadata labeling issue, not a validity problem. The CVJ for reduced-form rows contains an 'estimation' top-level key instead of the standard 'extra' key, a minor schema deviation."
