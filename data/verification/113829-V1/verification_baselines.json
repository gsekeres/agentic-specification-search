Specs changing treatment to decomposed connection measures (pcinter, acinter, pcconnected, acconnected, polcon_only) are alternative treatments not testing the same estimand. Alternative outcomes (recovery, actualhours, etc.) not part of core claim. robust/sample/no_polcheck_mills reports capacity as treatment (interall is zero for never-connected mills, extraction artifact). robust/control/minimal duplicates robust/control/capacity_only exactly."
