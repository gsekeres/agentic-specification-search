  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Understanding International Prices: Customers as Capital' by Drozd & Nosal (AER 2012). This is a descriptive statistics / calibration targets paper -- no regression analysis. The empirical content consists of computing cross-country averages of correlations and volatility ratios on HP-filtered (or otherwise detrended) macroeconomic time series from OECD national accounts data (1980Q1-2004Q2, 12 countries). The specification search systematically varies 5 dimensions: (1) detrending method (HP, linear, first-diff), (2) HP filter parameter (7 values), (3) sample period (8 windows), (4) price deflator (CPI vs PPI for Facts 1-2; national accounts for Fact 3), and (5) country subset (8 subsets). The 16 corr_EPI_IPI_nominal specs (nominal export-import price correlations) lack a flagged baseline; the natural baseline (spec 2881: hp1600, full sample, all 12 countries) is assigned to G1 as a supplementary statistic since it measures the same correlation concept without real deflation. Total: 3064 specs across 5 outcome statistics. Small numerical differences from published values arise because the specification search uses the OECD REER directly rather than constructing a trade-weighted RER from bilateral exchange rates with time-varying weights as in the original MATLAB code."
