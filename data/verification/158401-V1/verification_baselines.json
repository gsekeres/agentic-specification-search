  "global_notes": "Two baseline groups matching the pre-run surface exactly. G1 = Table 5 Panel A (investment, 8 outcomes). G2 = Table 6 Panel A (productivity/income, 8 outcomes). Both share the same cluster-RCT design (20 villages, 12T/8C, ITT with ANCOVA). All 70 specifications preserve baseline claim objects (same treatment buy_treatment, same estimand ITT, same population). Outcome transformations (asinh, log1p) change scale but preserve concept. 12 failed specifications all share the same root cause: household characteristics variable naming mismatch (hh_ prefix), producing 0 observations. One duplicate result: 158401-V1__049 (drop_first_post_season, expenses_postharvest) is numerically identical to baseline 158401-V1__007, because expenses_postharvest is only measured in later post-treatment seasons making the season drop a no-op. No baseline-group assignments were adjusted relative to the surface."
