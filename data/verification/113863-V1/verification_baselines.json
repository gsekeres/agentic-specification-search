  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Marriage Networks, Nepotism and Labor Market Outcomes in China' (AEJ: Applied Economics). The identification strategy exploits the timing of father-in-law (FIL) death as a shock that severs nepotistic employment connections. Two independent datasets are used: CHNS (panel, 1989-2006, N~2000) and SLCC (retrospective panel, 1950s-1999, N~13000). The CHNS baseline is only marginally significant (p=0.075) but the direction is robust (96% of core CHNS specs yield negative coefficients). The SLCC replication provides stronger statistical significance (p=0.041). Key design validation: mother-in-law (MIL) death has no effect (positive and insignificant), female placebo tests show no effect, and the effect is concentrated in state/collective sectors (where nepotism is predicted to matter). There are 79 total specifications across both datasets. The 'baseline_extended' spec adds marriage duration and health controls to the baseline and is classified as a core control variation rather than a separate baseline. The spec 'panel/sample/include_1989' and 'panel/sample/no_singletons' are exact duplicates of the baseline (identical coefficients), likely because the baseline sample already excludes 1989 and singletons. The 'panel/fe/unit_only' and 'panel/fe/twoway_id_prov' specs also have identical coefficients (-0.0948), indicating that Province FE is collinear with individual FE (province does not vary within individual)."
