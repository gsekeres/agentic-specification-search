  "global_notes": "Paper has three baseline outcomes representing the same treatment effect decomposed: overall, domestic, and foreign universalism. Most robustness specifications focus on the primary outcome (univ_overall) in G1. Several specifications are exact duplicates of baseline (same coefficient/SE), including: robust/cluster/strata, robust/estimation/country_fe_only, robust/funcform/quadratic_age, robust/weights/survey_weighted, robust/sample/complete_cases, and robust/control/add_income_code. The heterogeneity specs report the main effect coefficient from an interaction model, not the interaction term itself, which makes them difficult to interpret as tests of the main claim. Some outcome variations (raw data, difference) and treatment variations (deserving, moral_vs_deserving, three-arm) change the estimand."
