  "global_notes": "Paper is 'What Determines Giving to Hurricane Katrina Victims?' by Fong & Luttmer (AEJ: Applied 2009). This is a survey experiment with randomized picture (black/white/obscured victims) and audio manipulations. The specification search tests the MAIN EFFECT of picshowblack across 157 specifications covering 4 outcomes (giving, hypgiv_tc500, subjsupchar, subjsupgov), 9 perception outcomes, 1 manipulation check (per_hfhdif), 3 race subsamples (all/white/black), multiple city/survey subsamples (Table 5 variants), control variations (no controls, minimal, extra, LOO), and inference variations (unweighted OLS). CRITICAL CAVEAT: The paper's actual contribution is about INTERACTION effects (picshowblack x racial attitudes), not main effects. The weak/insignificant main effect on giving is expected and reported as such in the paper. The specification search is therefore testing a claim that the paper itself frames as ambiguous. Three duplicates identified: ctrl_full_manip_all = baseline_tab3_col2, ctrl_full_manip_white = baseline_tab3_col5_white, ctrl_full_manip_black = baseline_tab3_col6_black (identical coefficients). Also tab5_hypgiv_tc500_s1_baseline_white = outcome_hypgiv_tc500_white, tab5_subjsupchar_s1_baseline_white = outcome_subjsupchar_white, tab5_subjsupgov_s1_baseline_white = outcome_subjsupgov_white. And loo_drop_black_white = loo_drop_other_white (race dummies irrelevant in white-only subsample)."
