These are documented in SPECIFICATION_SEARCH.md and are valid distinct spec_ids representing different conceptual paths to the same numerical result.",
    "Treatment variable is consistently picshowblack across all 135 rows. No treatment drift.",
    "Outcome variables within each group are consistent except for the outcome preprocessing specs in G1 (giving_tc99, giving_winsor) and G2 (hypgiv_tc250, hypgiv_notc), which are valid preprocessing RCs that transform the outcome concept without changing it.",
    "The race_shown_only subpopulation (picobscur==0) creates perfect collinearity between picraceb and picshowblack. One treatment arm is dropped automatically. The coefficient on picshowblack becomes black-vs-white (excluding obscured), which is a slightly different estimand but is flagged in SPECIFICATION_SEARCH.md. Classified as core_sample (conservative).",
    "The full_sample subpopulation pools white and black respondents. This changes the target population but is a standard sample RC. The diluted effect is expected since black respondents show the opposite pattern."
