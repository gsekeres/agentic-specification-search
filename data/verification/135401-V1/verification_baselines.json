  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Breastfeeding and Child Development' by Del Bono & Giardili (AEJ:Applied 2022). The specification search extracted 194 specs from Stata output files (data is confidential). Only spec_id 7 is marked is_baseline=True in the CSV (cog_index, NTSLS Exposure). However, specs 8 and 9 are the equivalent NTSLS Exposure results for non_cog_index and health_index, representing the paper's secondary and tertiary claims from the same table. We define three baseline groups corresponding to the three outcome domains. Core tests include: (a) alternative estimation methods (OLS, 2SLS, NTSLS) with same outcome and treatment; (b) alternative instruments (polynomial vs exposure); (c) alternative breastfeeding duration thresholds (bfd30, bfd60, bfd120) which change treatment operationalization; (d) robustness sample restrictions from Table F7. Non-core specs include individual cognitive/non-cognitive/health components (which are different outcomes from the summary indices) and percentile-transformed cognitive scores. Spec 105 (w2_obesity, OLS) has a missing coefficient and is marked invalid. Specs 10-11 appear to be duplicates (both OLS cog_index from the polynomial source file). Many component-level specs (45-194) test sub-outcomes rather than the summary indices."
