Multiple baselines: unweighted (-5.51, p=0.19), with controls (-4.92, p=0.002), nearby districts (-4.76, p=0.005), continuous treatment (-6.62, p=0.003). The paper's main contribution is that LINKED data shows opposite results (positive mortality effect). These aggregate results demonstrate the migration bias."

  "global_notes": "This specification search uses aggregate registrar data. The paper's key insight is that migration bias causes aggregate mortality statistics to understate true health effects. The negative DiD coefficient in aggregate data supports this -- healthy individuals migrated out of cotton districts. Two-period design (1851-1855 vs 1861-1865). 84.5% of specs show negative coefficients."
