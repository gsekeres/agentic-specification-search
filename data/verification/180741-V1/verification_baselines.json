  "verifier_notes": "All three baseline groups from SPECIFICATION_SURFACE.json are present in specification_results.csv. No baseline group reassignments were made. All 69 rows executed successfully (run_success=1). Two near-duplicate pairs flagged in G2: rc/sample/restrict_conflict_only == baseline__tablec1_col1 and rc/sample/restrict_noconflict_only == baseline__tablec1_col2 (identical estimates) -- these are structurally expected since the baselines are defined on those exact subsamples. All rows use canonical inference infer/se/hc/hc3.",
  "global_notes": "No baseline group reassignments relative to the surface. G3 p-values appear as machine epsilon (e.g., 5.77e-15) rather than exact zero due to floating-point precision in statsmodels/pyfixest HC3 computation -- these are valid and indicate highly significant effects. Design-level specs (G1 diff_in_means, with_covariates) use N=5915 vs baseline col3 N=5908, reflecting a slightly different sample filter (design specs appear to use the unfiltered Choice sample while baselines use Highx10==0 & Highx100==0 restriction); this is a minor scope difference within the same claim object and does not invalidate core status. Inference variants (infer/se/hc/hc1, infer/se/hc/hc2) correctly appear only in inference_results.csv (15 rows: G1x2 variants x 3 baselines = 6, G2x2 variants x 3 baselines = 6, G3x1 variant x 3 baselines = 3).",
