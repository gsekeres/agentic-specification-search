This is the primary result: panel FE regression of effort on wage, limited dummy, and limited*wage interaction, with subject FE and SEs clustered by subject. Sample is employees (type==2) in the base treatment (treatmentid==3) who accepted contracts (acceptance==1). The positive coefficient on 'limited' means that at zero wage, limited discretion contracts elicit about 2.7 more effort units. The interaction term (limitedwage) captures how this effect varies with the wage offered."

  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Screening, Competition, and Job Design' by Bartling, Fehr, and Schmidt (AER 2012). This is a lab experiment with employer-employee pairs. The specification search focuses on the base treatment result (Table 1) showing that limited discretion contracts elicit more effort from employees. There is only one baseline group because the primary claim centers on a single regression (Table 1, Col 1) with 'limited' as the key treatment variable. The paper also analyzes a screening treatment (Table 2), which uses different samples (treatmentid==1) and adds reputation controls; these are classified as non-core treatment variations since they test a distinct claim about competition/reputation interacting with contract type. Profit regressions (Table 1 Col 3) and acceptance regressions are classified as non-core alternative outcomes since they test different dependent variables. The specification search produced 88 specifications total. Some specs (sample/base_first_sessions) are exact duplicates of the baseline because the base treatment only runs in sessions 400-600. Inference variations share the same point estimate (2.731) since they only change SE computation. The between estimator and ordered probit yield insignificant results, suggesting the effect is primarily within-subject (panel) rather than cross-sectional."
