Outcome is industry employment deviation from trend in 1993 (detrended using 1980-89 log-linear trend per paper methodology). Treatment is 1988 share of exports going to USSR/Russia. Coefficient matches paper Figure 1 Panel C (-14.54). SE differs slightly from paper (6.44 vs 6.04), likely due to minor detrending differences."

  "global_notes": "Single baseline claim. The paper is primarily a calibrated GE model paper with one key cross-sectional empirical result (Figure 1 Panel C). The specification search generated 87 total specifications exploring robustness. Key sensitivity: result reverses sign under uniform 1980-89 detrending and 1985-89 detrending; pre-period placebos (1989, 1990) are significant, suggesting potential pre-trends."
