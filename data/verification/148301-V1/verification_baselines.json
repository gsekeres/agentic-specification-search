  "global_notes": "This specification search uses SIMULATED data (not original BEA data), so coefficient magnitudes are calibrated approximations rather than true replications. 64 total specifications. Some leave-one-out control specs produce coefficients identical to baseline, suggesting orthogonal simulated controls. Alternative treatment specs (tax_haven, low_tax_15, low_tax_20, low_tax_25) use different treatment definitions with positive expected signs and different FE structures (no country FE)."
