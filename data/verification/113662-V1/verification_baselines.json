  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Expertise vs. Bias in Evaluation: Evidence from the NIH' by Danielle Li (AER, 2017). CRITICAL CAVEAT: All results are on synthetic data generated to match the variable structure of the confidential NIH administrative data. The original data is not publicly available. Coefficients demonstrate the specification search methodology but should not be interpreted as replicating the original findings. The paper studies whether permanent NIH review committee members who have cited an applicant's work influence that applicant's funding outcomes, and whether this reflects expertise or bias. The primary treatment variable is num_prevs_cite_app (count of permanent members citing the applicant). There are 115 total specifications across 14 categories. Three specifications have NaN p-values due to degenerate clustering in very small subsamples. Spec baseline/T5_col3_MAIN is the primary specification corresponding to Table 5, Column 3 of the original paper."
