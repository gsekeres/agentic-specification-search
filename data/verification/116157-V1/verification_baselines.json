  "global_notes": "Single baseline group. The paper has one primary claim: sophisticated investors (proxied by low expense ratio share classes) ran harder during the crisis. Specifications 044, 045, 069-070 use fund/complex FE with expense ratio as within-fund treatment, which is an alternative identification strategy testing the same underlying claim. Specifications 075-079 are auxiliary (Table 1 first-stage, Table 4 dynamics) supporting identification rather than the main result. spec_025 (incl_retail) produces identical coefficients to spec_001 because the sample restriction ER<=35bp already excludes retail classes."
