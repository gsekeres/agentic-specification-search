  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Vocational Training for Disadvantaged Youth in Colombia: A Long Term Follow Up' by Attanasio, Guarin, Medina & Meghir (AEJ-Applied 2017). Randomized lottery assignment of training slots provides clean identification. Microdata not included in the replication package; all 50 specifications were extracted from Stata log files. Two independent samples are used throughout: (1) Entire Cohort (EC, N=372648 person-months, admin data only, treatment indicator select_h1, clustered by id_h), and (2) Evaluation Sample (ES, N=306696, conditions on baseline survey participation, uses sampling weights, treatment indicator TK, clustered by llave_pe). The EC and ES baselines for each outcome constitute a single baseline group because they estimate the same treatment effect using different samples from the same experiment. The displacement specs (8 total) test whether treatment intensity (proportion treated in local labor market) affects outcomes, addressing general equilibrium crowding-out concerns. Balance tests (11 specs) check covariate balance between treatment and control groups. Heterogeneity specs decompose effects by gender."
