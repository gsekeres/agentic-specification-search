Controls: black illiteracy (1910), county formation year, newspaper rate (1840), farm value (1860), small farm proportion, land inequality, free black proportion."

  "global_notes": "Cross-sectional study of 267 counties in 6 Southern states. Identification relies on within-state variation controlling for historical observables. Main result is highly robust across control variations, sample restrictions, and estimation methods. Placebo tests pass: white lynching has no effect on black registration; black lynching has no effect on white registration. Sensitivity to population denominator: using 1920 or 1930 population attenuates effects substantially."
