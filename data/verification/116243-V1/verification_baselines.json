      "notes": "This is a structural MLE paper with confidential BEA data. No re-estimation or alternative specifications are possible. All 151 'specifications' are individual parameter estimates extracted from the same single estimation run (Fortran output file outjpe810). The baseline row reports the core technology parameter RET (returns to scale = 0.165, t = 49.71) with the full coefficient vector including MU, THETA, and ATRU. The log-likelihood for the full model is -272,235.41. Because parameters are jointly estimated, individual t-statistics do not have the same interpretation as in reduced-form regressions."

  "global_notes": "STRUCTURAL MODEL -- SINGLE ESTIMATION RUN. This paper develops and estimates a 401-parameter (168 iterated) structural model of U.S. MNC production, trade, and discrete choice decisions. The underlying BEA microdata on 551 MNCs over 14 years (1983-1996) is confidential and cannot be accessed. Consequently, the specification search could not re-estimate the model or test alternative specifications. Instead, it extracted all 151 individual parameter coefficients from the final iteration output, organized by model component (technology, demand, labor, materials, capital, trade costs, discrete choice, variance-covariance, Box-Cox). Because all parameters come from a single joint estimation, there is no meaningful variation in model specification, sample, controls, or estimation method across rows. The 'specifications' are decomposed components of a single result, not independent robustness tests. Classification as core vs. non-core is based on whether each parameter group is central to the paper's main claims about MNC trade growth."
