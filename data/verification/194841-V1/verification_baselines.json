  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Rational Inattention and the Business Cycle Effects of Productivity and News Shocks' by Mackowiak and Wiederholt (AER). The key empirical test is the Coibion-Gorodnichenko regression of forecast errors on forecast revisions using Survey of Professional Forecasters GDP data (1969-2019). This is a pure time-series regression (no panel structure). The finding of beta > 0 indicates under-reaction consistent with information rigidities. The result is robust to inference variations (HC1-HC3, HAC, bootstrap) but sensitive to dynamic specifications (controlling for lagged forecast errors reverses the sign) and to time period (stronger in later sample, weaker in early sample). Some specifications (robust/sample/subsample1_early and robust/sample/early_period) appear to be duplicates with identical coefficients."
