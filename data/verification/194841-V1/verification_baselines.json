  "global_notes": "This paper has a single core empirical claim tested via the CG regression. The specification search produced 70 specifications total. Several rows duplicate earlier rows (early_period = subsample1_early; late_period = subsample2_late). Some alternative outcome specifications (absolute, squared, sign, large_error) change the estimand substantially and are classified as non-core. Heterogeneity interaction terms test moderation rather than the main claim and are classified as non-core. Placebo tests are correctly identified. Growth rate functional form reverses sign. First differences and GLS AR(1) reverse sign."
