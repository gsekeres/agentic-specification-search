## Robustness Assessment

**STRONG** support for the main hypothesis.

Very robust result. DEA crackdowns reduce opioid dispensing by ~35 MME per capita. Effect is significant across all clustering, sample restriction, control, and functional form specifications. Placebo tests pass (no pre-treatment effect, no effect on unaffected outcome). Effect is strongest in the South and in high-baseline-opioid counties. County FE are critical for identification.
