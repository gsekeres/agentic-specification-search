  "global_notes": "This paper estimates worker surplus as ratios (wage/WTA) where >1 indicates positive surplus. The treatment_var is coded as mean_surplus for baselines, which is descriptive (not causal regression). spec_ids baseline and baseline_weighted are reused across groups (distinguished by outcome_var). Control variation and OLS predictor specs change treatment to log_numjobs etc., testing different estimands. Heterogeneity specs also use different treatments (c_US, high_experience). Sample restriction and tercile splits are borderline between core_sample and noncore_heterogeneity but are classified as core because they compute the same mean surplus in subsamples rather than testing interaction effects."
