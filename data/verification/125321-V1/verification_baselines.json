      "notes": "Baseline coefficient 32.71 ug/m3 (p<0.001). After automation, reported PM10 increases by ~33 ug/m3, indicating substantial prior under-reporting. Effect is robust across polynomial orders, FE structures, controls, and sample restrictions. 90% positive, 83% significant at 5%. Local RD estimates at narrow bandwidths are noisy but directionally consistent."

  "global_notes": "RD study of automated pollution monitoring in China. 70 total specs. Staggered RD design (different cities automated at different times). The increase in reported PM10 after automation is very robust to parametric specifications. Local polynomial RD at narrow bandwidths (30-60 days) shows noisy insignificant estimates, but wider bandwidths confirm the finding. Placebo tests on weather variables show no discontinuity. Alternative pollutants (SO2, NO2) also show increases after automation."
