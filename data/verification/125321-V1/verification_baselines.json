  "global_notes": "70 specifications total. Single baseline clearly identified (spec_id=baseline). Key issues: (1) The placebo cutoff tests (rd/placebo/cutoff_*) appear mis-implemented -- they shift the cutoff date but the after variable likely still references the true automation date, so they remain significant because they still capture the true treatment effect. These are not valid placebo tests and all show large significant coefficients (29.8-31.2). (2) SO2 and NO2 are different outcome variables testing a related but distinct claim about other pollutants. (3) The bandwidth/kernel specifications use local polynomial methods producing quite different point estimates from the parametric baseline (e.g., coef~1.8 at bw=90 vs ~32.7 parametric). (4) Heterogeneity specs (wave_1_local, wave_2_local) are subgroup analyses using local polynomial RD with bw=90. (5) Three pairs of duplicate specifications exist: rd/kernel/triangular = rd/bandwidth/fixed_90d, robust/control/add_1_wind_speed = robust/control/only_wind_speed, robust/control/add_4_rh = baseline."
