  "global_notes": "This is a descriptive statistics paper (Banerjee, Karlan, Zinman, AEJ:Applied 2015) introducing the microcredit special issue. The replication package computes summary statistics from MIX Market data. There are no causal claims or regression-based identification. The 1,736 specifications systematically vary 7 analytical dimensions: sample restriction, number of top lenders, country subset, compounding method, loss variable, APR formula, and summary statistic. The 108 OLS specifications regress APR on country dummies with HC1 standard errors. Key findings: (1) Mean APR is robust at >20% across all 780 APR mean specs; (2) Mexico's APR premium is significant (p<0.05) in all 18 OLS Mexico specs; (3) Compounding method and Mexico inclusion are the largest sources of variation; (4) Loss variable choice has minimal impact."
