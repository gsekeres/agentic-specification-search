  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Is the EITC as Good as an NIT? Conditional Cash Transfers and Tax Incidence' by Rothstein (AEJ:EP 2010). This is a STRUCTURAL CALIBRATION paper, not a reduced-form regression study. There are no standard errors, p-values, or regression coefficients. Specifications correspond to different parameterizations of a general equilibrium labor market model. The 388 total specifications vary across: 3 structural parameters (sigma_e, sigma_i, rho), 6+ labor market cell definitions, 2 programs (EITC vs NIT), multiple demographic subgroups, 3 sample restrictions, and multiple outcome measures. The central claim -- NIT totxfer > EITC totxfer -- holds in 100% of comparable specification pairs. EITC totxfer < 1 in 82% of All-group specs; NIT totxfer > 1 in 99%."
