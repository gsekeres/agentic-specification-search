The coefficient represents the difference in disclosure probability between A+ and CD- restaurants. The paper also claims countersignaling (A+ restaurants with alternative quality signals disclose less), but the main estimand for the specification search is the A+ disclosure premium relative to CD-."

  "global_notes": "67 specifications with one clear baseline. Several heterogeneity specifications report interaction term coefficients rather than the main A+ coefficient, meaning they test the countersignaling hypothesis rather than providing a robustness check of the main signaling claim. The within-A-grade sample restriction (spec robust/sample/isA_pred1) changes the comparison group from CD- to A-, yielding a negative coefficient that represents a conceptually different estimand. Some functional form specs use a continuous treatment (num_grading) rather than the binary half-grade indicator, changing the treatment concept. Two alternative treatment specs (top_half_A, A_tercile_1) use different definitions of treatment but test a related hypothesis about within-grade quality and disclosure."
