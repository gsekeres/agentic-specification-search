  "global_notes": "Methods paper with two empirical applications (cement and airlines). Key issues: (1) iv/method/ols duplicates baseline exactly; (2) LOO controls for cement start from the full-controls model, not the no-controls baseline; (3) quadratic spec reports linear term of quadratic, not comparable to elasticity; (4) direct_only and connecting_only change from nested to simple logit, altering model structure; (5) some IV specs (cpi_ng_price, cpi_wage_hr) have weak first stages producing sign reversals."
