    "The quadratic treatment specs (rc/form/model/quadratic_treatment, rc/joint/outlier_form/drop_weitzman_quadratic) report the coefficient on the linear logt term with logt^2 included. This preserves the baseline claim object (the focal coefficient is still the logt elasticity), though the interpretation changes in the presence of the quadratic term. These are retained as core."
