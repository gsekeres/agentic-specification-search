  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Optimal Climate Policy When Damages Are Unknown' (AEJ Policy). The specification search covers Table 1's meta-regression only. The structural model outputs (optimal carbon taxes, welfare calculations) depend on these parameter estimates but are not varied here. The bootstrap spec (robust/se/bootstrap) has an anomalous p-value of 1.012, likely a coding issue. Leave-one-out analysis (15 specs) shows no single influential study. Strong heterogeneity by study type: market-only estimates yield d2~0 while non-market estimates yield d2~3.9."
