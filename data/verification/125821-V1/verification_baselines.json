  "global_notes": "Paper studies Wisconsin school referendum elections using RDD. The baseline is only marginally significant (p=0.063). The running variable is vote percentage centered at 50%. 79% of specs show positive coefficients. The spec rd/bandwidth/bw10 is an exact duplicate of baseline. Polynomial linear specs at BW=30,45,60 duplicate bandwidth specs. Several kernel specs (triangular, uniform, epanechnikov) produce identical results to baseline."
