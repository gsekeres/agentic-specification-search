Coefficient=641.24, p=0.063. Note that rd/bandwidth/bw10, rd/controls/baseline, rd/kernel/triangular, rd/kernel/uniform, and rd/kernel/epanechnikov all produce identical results to the baseline (exact duplicates). Similarly, rd/poly/global_linear and rd/bandwidth/full are identical."

  "global_notes": "Of 62 total specifications, several spec_ids are exact duplicates of the baseline (identical coefficients, SEs, p-values): rd/bandwidth/bw10, rd/controls/baseline, and all three kernel variants (triangular, uniform, epanechnikov). Also rd/poly/global_linear and rd/bandwidth/full are identical. The kernel specifications appear to not have been implemented with actual kernel weighting, producing spurious robustness that is actually repetition. Alternative outcomes (8 specs) test different claims and are classified as non-core. Placebo cutoff tests (4 specs) and heterogeneity interaction terms (3 specs) are non-core by design."
