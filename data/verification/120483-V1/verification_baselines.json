State-clustered SEs used as canonical fallback since Conley spatial SEs are unavailable in pyfixest."

  "global_notes": "Surface-driven run. One baseline group (G1) matches the pre-run surface. The surface listed two baseline specs (Table1-Col3 for 1790 and Table1-Col5 for 1860), but only Col5 was coded as the single baseline row. The 1790 data appears as rc/sample/restrict/1790_data instead. This is a minor deviation from the surface plan but is coherent: the 1860 specification is the paper's main result and the 1790 variant is treated as a sample restriction robustness check. Inference uses state-clustered SEs (infer/se/cluster/state) as canonical fallback since the surface's canonical Conley 100km SEs are not available in pyfixest."
