  "global_notes": "Paper studies malaria ecology and slavery in early US. County-level cross-sectional analysis with state FE. 76 total specs. Multiple baseline variants across 1790/1860 data and control sets. The 1860 results are stronger than 1790. Alternative malaria measures (MAL_temp, MAL_risk, MAL_clim) all confirm the finding. Political outcome specs (voting patterns) provide supporting but secondary evidence."
