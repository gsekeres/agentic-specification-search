  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Reshaping Adolescents' Gender Attitudes' (AER). The specification search uses a simplified gender index rather than the paper's Anderson inverse-covariance-weighted index. The baseline effect is positive but insignificant (p=0.42); however, significant heterogeneity by gender exists: boys show 0.062 SD (p=0.02) while girls show -0.025 SD (p=0.29). All 53 specs use the same outcome (E_Sgender_index2_std) and treatment (B_treat) except for 3 alternative outcome specs and 3 placebo specs."
