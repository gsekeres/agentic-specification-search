  "global_notes": "Three baseline groups match the surface exactly. G1 covers cement floor coverage (housing first stage, household-level data). G2 covers maternal mental health and life satisfaction (household-level data). G3 covers child health outcomes (individual-level data, children 0-5). All baseline groups have treatment_var=dpisofirme, inference=infer/se/cluster/idcluster. No adjustments made to baseline group assignments from the surface. G2 and G3 run rc/* rows across all outcome variants simultaneously (not just the primary baseline outcome), which is correct practice for a multi-outcome claim group. Trim rows produce identical coefficients to baseline for share/binary outcomes (S_shcementfloor, S_satisfloor, S_diarrhea) because these bounded outcomes have no extremal outliers; this is a real empirical finding, not a coding error. G3 rc/controls/loo/drop_S_age and rc/controls/loo/drop_S_gender produce identical coefficients to rc/controls/sets/model4 (n_controls differs: 89 vs 91), suggesting S_age and S_gender do not move the treatment coefficient; plausible for a randomized experiment with balanced baseline characteristics. Inference variants (infer/se/hc/hc1, infer/se/cluster/idmun) correctly appear only in inference_results.csv. Gap in spec_run_id sequence (runs 036-037, 068, and 099 are in inference_results.csv) is expected.",
