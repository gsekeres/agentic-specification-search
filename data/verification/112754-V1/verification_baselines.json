  "global_notes": "Paper is 'Search, Liquidity, and the Dynamics of House Prices and Construction' by Head, Lloyd-Ellis, and Sun (AER 2014). The main empirical contribution is a structural Panel VAR(2) with 5 endogenous variables (income, price, sales growth, construction rate, population growth) estimated via equation-by-equation LSDV on 106 US MSAs, 1982-2007. The primary result of interest (G1) is the income-to-price coefficient, which calibrates the structural search model. The other 4 equations (G2-G5) are also baseline components of the full VAR system. The specification search reports 65 total specifications. Most robustness checks focus on the price equation (G1) income coefficient. The spec search confirms the main result (L1_wx = 0.2909) is replicable and matches the paper's reported estimates. The VAR(1) specification produces a near-zero, insignificant price-income coefficient (0.0005), suggesting the lag structure matters. The result is sensitive to time period (early-only gives 0.065, insignificant), outlier treatment (winsorize/trim at 5% reduces to 0.04-0.13), and geographic subsample (coastal cities: 0.11 vs non-coastal: 0.38). Five L2 income coefficient specs and four price-effect-on-other-variables specs extract different parameters from the same baseline VAR system and are classified as non-core."
