  "global_notes": "Complete run failure. All 40 specifications failed because the replication package provides raw NLSY .dct files that require Stata-specific data construction steps (weekly-to-monthly panel conversion, job transition coding, skill mismatch computation). The Python runner cannot execute these steps. The surface plan and spec_id assignments are coherent with the pre-run surface, but no numerical results exist to verify."
